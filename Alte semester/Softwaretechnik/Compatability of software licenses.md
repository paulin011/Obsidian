Desired Incompatibilities
•
proprietary licenses are typically specific to a program and incompatible to each other
•
copyleft licenses are incompatible to proprietary and permissive licenses
•
software licensed with GPL cannot be used within MIT-licensed software

Undesired Incompatibilities
•
software licensed with GPL-2.0-only cannot be used within GPLv3- or LGPLv3-licensed software (cf. Linux kernel) → most projects use GPL-2.0-or-later instead
•
software licensed with GPLv3 cannot be used in material licensed as creative commons BY-SA 4.0
