Advantages 
Easy to understand good for system development with high manufacturing costs for hardware

easier to use one model like in hardawre

combination with formal system development feasible (e.g., B method)

Disatvantages
Stages should communicate
its difficult to change privious changes
requires good clear and stable upfront requirements and design

Example Domains
embedded systems where software must interface with hardware systems critical systems with extensive safety and security analysis of specification and design large software systems that are typically developed by several companies
