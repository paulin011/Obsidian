Pen(etration) Testing 
• Authorized simulated cyberattack on a computer system, performed to evaluate the security of the system 
• Penetration testing checks the SUT in an end -to -end fashion, which means that it is done once the application is fully implemented. 


• Pen testing tools contain a **Vulnerability** Scanner module that either runs existing exploits or allow the tester to create an exploit. They also contain **Password Crackers** that either brute -force passwords or perform a dictionary attack (i.e., choose inputs from pre -existing password lists).
