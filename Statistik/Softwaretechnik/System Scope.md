System Scope 
▪ Elements within the context of a system are sources of requirements 
▪ Each requirement must be justified by a context element
▪ The justification is called the requirement’s rationale
▪ The system boundary determines what is part of the system-underdevelopment and what is part of the environment that has a relation to the system
▪ The context boundary distinguishes the relevant from the irrelevant parts of the environment 
▪ The system interface determines the interaction possibilities with elements in the context at runtime
▪ System boundary, context boundary, and interface may change over time
