| Maintenance | Evolution |
| ---- | ---- |
| Corrections | New or removed functionality |
| Small Changes | large changes |
| patches and hotfixes | often planned ahead and not as a response |
| mostly minor releases | Major releases |

• An evolving system increases its complexity unless work is done to reduce it.
• Although software does not wear out, it needs to be maintained to remain functional.
