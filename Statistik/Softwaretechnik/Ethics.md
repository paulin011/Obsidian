Do they work?
Research shows that the code of ethics does not appear to affect the decisions made by software developers :(

Do we need it?
•
Software engineers often have large autonomy (e.g., push to production)
•
Fast release cycles
•
Time and budget pressures
•
Bug-free SW virtually impossible

So, what can we do?

Awareness and Explicit Consideration
•
Incorporating ethics into the software development life cycle.
•
Establishing ethical guidelines within development teams.
•
Encouraging open communication about ethical concerns within the workplace.
