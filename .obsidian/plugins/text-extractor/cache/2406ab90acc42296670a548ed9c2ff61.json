This pressure comes from the general public, civil society, and government institutions. In parallel is a growing recognition that current ethics review procedures within ICT may not address broader concerns (such as the potential societal consequences of innovation). Instances of ICT raising concerns abound. For example, along with attention-grabbing headlines that artificial intelligence (AI) could ultimately pose an existential threat to humankind, there are more prosaic, yet strongly felt, social transformations already associated with AI technolo- gies. For example, AI is an increasingly powerful protagonist in the story of how digital technologies are trans- forming the nature of work, as more types of work are mediated digitally, including how it is allocated, assessed, and rewarded. With these new forms of digital agency driving important as- pects of labor markets, questions arise as to whose interests are being served and how accountability and transpar- ency can be assured. This is but one example of many debates around technology-, product-, and process-based innovation. Poten- tial conflicts are wide-ranging and, most important, often emerge only af- ter technologies have been embedded into the mainstream. ICT scholars and professionals have long tried to understand and address these issues, though there are still nu- merous areas of concern. A novel con- cept—“responsible research and inno- vation,” or RRI —has emerged recently in response to the challenge of design- ing innovations in a socially desirable and acceptable way. It may be useful for framing the discussion about how to manage the introduction of future innovations in ICT. In this article, we discuss the origins of RRI, consider relevant research from computer eth- ics and human-computer interaction (HCI), and illustrate the need for a new approach for the governance of ICT research. Finally, we suggest ways researchers might draw upon a frame- work for RRI in ICT based on the find- ings of an interview study conducted Responsible Research and Innovation in the Digital Age DOI:10.1145/3064940 RRI requires doing the best science for the world, not only the best science in the world. BY MARINA JIROTKA, BARBARA GRIMPE, BERND STAHL, GRACE EDEN, AND MARK HARTSWOOD key insights ˽ Responsible research and innovation aims to ensure that the processes and outcomes of research are aligned with societal values. ˽ Our qualitative interview study found that ICT raises particular challenges for RRI; ICT researchers are best positioned to be able to identify them. ˽ We propose a context-specific and flexible framework for RRI in ICT to help researchers use it as a source of inspiration and creativity. MAY 2017 | VOL. 60 | NO. 5 | COMMUNICATIONS OF THE ACM 6364 COMMUNICATIONS OF THE ACM | MAY 2017 | VOL. 60 | NO. 5 contributed articles Though these approaches to identi- fying and debating ethical conflicts and questions are valuable, what is lacking today is a way to combine them in a manner that will allow a broad range of stakeholders to systematically engage with the goals, purposes, challenges, problems, and solutions encountered in research and innovation processes. This means individual researchers, re- search institutions, professional bod- ies, research funders, industry, and civil society all need to collaborate more. In practice, it means incorporating differ- ent kinds of knowledge, including from citizens, to inform the goals, direc- tions, and trajectories of innovation in an inclusive way. This has been the case in some areas, as in, say, privacy and data protection, where longstanding debates have led to regulation and leg- islation, and to innovation in methods for design. However, such processes of collective reflection and deliberation have not yet happened in many areas of ICT. In light of the societal importance of ICT, broader engagement may now be necessary. Other areas of research and innovation that have been more so- cially contested have a longer history of engagement. We thus propose to look at RRI as a discourse that has evolved from these more contested fields, in- cluding whether and how it may be ap- plied to ICT. Scope of RRI RRI initiatives across policy, academic research and scholarship, and legis- lation emerged more than a decade ago. 5,15 It began by aiming to identify and address uncertainties and risks as- sociated with novel areas of research, beginning with nanotechnology 5 and moving to the environmental and health sciences, including geo-engi- neering 18 and synthetic biology. 21 The scope of RRI has since expanded to include computer science, robotics, in- formatics, and ICT more generally. 8 RRI proposes a new process for the gover- nance of research and innovation. The aim is to ensure science and innovation are undertaken in the public interest by incorporating methods for encour- aging more inclusive and democratic decision making through greater inclu- sion of stakeholder communities that might be directly affected by the intro- duction of novel technologies. That is, RRI proposes a more re- flective and inclusive research and in- novation process, from fundamental research through to application de- sign. In each phase of the innovation process, certain responsibilities may be associated with activities that occur within them, particularly in relation to how decisions taken might affect society. The focus is on creating a new mode of practical research governance that would transform existing process- es, ensuring greater acceptability and even desirability of novel research and innovation outcomes, while also iden- tifying and managing potential risks and uncertainties. RRI requires widen- ing the scope of research and develop- ment from governance of risk to gover- nance of innovation itself. 18 There is a broad debate over the con- ceptual foundations of RRI and ways to implement it in practice. The most ad- vanced framework for RRI today is prob- ably the one proposed by Stilgoe et al., 18 who also provided a non-exhaustive list of possible RRI methods, tools, and techniques (such as citizen juries and moratoriums). This approach has been taken up in E.U. policy and research, as in the RRI Tools project (https://www. rri-tools.eu/). It has also been adopted and adapted by the U.K. Engineering and Physical Science Research Coun- cil (EPSRC, https://www.epsrc.ac.uk/ research/framework/). The EPSRC framework uses the acronym AREA to describe four key RRI components: An- ticipate possible outcomes of research and innovation, Reflect on motivations, processes and products, Engage with relevant stakeholders, and Act accord- ingly to address issues revealed. The ideas behind RRI and the AREA framework may be easy enough to un- derstand but raise significant conceptu- al and practical questions. Fundamental problems include the fact that research and innovation do not follow linear and predictable patterns. Bunching together research and innovation blurs impor- tant boundaries and hides significant differences. To complicate matters, plu- ralistic democracies usually lack con- sensus as to what counts as acceptable and desirable. Additionally, stakeholder engagement can be misused for specific aims. The idea of RRI itself contains spe- cific values, and implementing it may engender power struggles. with the ICT community by investiga- tors at the University of Oxford and De Montfort University, both in the U.K., from 2011 to 2013. Ethics and Social Responsibility ICT has traditionally been associated with the development of tools with discrete and transparent functional- ity aimed at supporting specific tasks. However, its diversity, scope, and com- plexity have extended far beyond this view to become situated within the very fabric of our daily lives.17 Rather than being merely tools, the technolo- gies now being designed are arguably transforming and augmenting the world around us, where computer- generated information, objects, and infrastructures “coexist in the same space as the real world,” as outlined by Azuma et al.1 Debates about ethical issues in ICT are not new; researchers have been concerned with ethics in computing since at least the 1950s. 23 With the emergence of HCI in the 1980s, these debates have focused on the design of usable interactions between people and computers, where the broader eth- ical and societal aspects of application design and use have also been consid- ered.4 ICT researchers have tried to ad- dress ethical questions in many ways, as in, say, participatory design 13 and ICT for development.10 In addition to the approaches to ethics that come from within the ICT research and development commu- nity, there is a rich array of comple- mentary thought that likewise tries to address particular ethical issues. The field of computer ethics, which draws on philosophy and social sciences, as well as computer science and informa- tion systems, has a history of reflecting on the ethics of ICT. 6,11 Professional bodies like ACM (https:// ethics.acm.org/), IEEE (http://www. ieee.org/about/ethics.html), and BCS (http://www.bcs.org/category/6030) have developed codes and standards for professionals to follow when consid- ering ethical issues. While guidelines and standards are in place, there is an ongoing debate in regards to the limits of these approaches. A key question is whether or not future ethical and soci- etal challenges are likely to be amenable to being addressed this way.

It provides an important base- line, giving us an opportunity to de- scribe, understand, and triangulate ICT researchers’ and other stakehold- ers’ questions and concerns across a variety of computer science domains, including mobile computing, AI, pho- tonics, and signal processing. Many researchers welcome en- hancements to current governance processes (such as by framing ques- tions that help reflect on research out- puts). Also, some researchers embrace the further integration of social and ethical research into design and devel- opment. Apart from such perceived RRI opportunities, many interviewees in our study raised concerns. We outline five, as discussed by participants. Together, they identify typical problems involved in integrating RRI into ICT. We thus sought to relate them to concepts and approaches that would allow research- ers to specify RRI in ICT. The first is the difficulty of predict- ing the potential uses of research out- comes. Some researchers we inter- viewed said it may be inappropriate to attempt to predict future effects in the context of ICT research because the un- certainties tend to be social rather than scientific, meaning technologies are socially shaped and not fixed. Research- ers in the study cited two unknown factors related to prediction. First, in fundamental research, risks and uncer- tainties are identifiable only within the context of their use. Second, in appli- cation-oriented research, industry and user adaptation can change the trajec- tory of ICT in unforeseen ways. The very open nature of ICT, its logical mallea- bility, 12 interpretive flexibility, 2 and the social production of technology make it even more difficult to predict out- comes of research and innovation than in other areas of science and technol- ogy research. We refer to these aspects of ICT as related to the “product” of ICT research and innovation. A second concern points to the per- ceived differences between ascertain- Most participants in the RRI dis- course are well aware of these issues. 14 It is thus important to understand that RRI is not an attempt to invent a new top-down way of governing research and innovation but rather a way of link- ing and embedding existing principles and activities with a view to broadening their reach and relevance. This means RRI encompasses existing techniques for public engagement and reflec- tion (such as participatory design, re- search ethics, and professional codes) and aims to ensure they can develop synergies. It also means building on extant research into corporate ICT governance. More precisely, RRI may be understood as a demand for multi- level ethics (systemic and institutional macro ethics, in addition to individu- alistic micro ethics), engagement of a broader variety of stakeholders, and in- clusion of social, political, and ethical issues in ICT governance.7 It remains problematic, though, how these ideas can be put into practice. Embedding RRI in ICT Innovation Embedding RRI into ICT innovation is a challenge. First, it is necessary to understand how ICT researchers and practitioners manage their profession- al responsibilities, as well as how they perceive the notion of RRI, in order to assess how to move forward and fit fea- tures of RRI to researchers’ perceptions and expectations. One significant is- sue is how to develop a set of practical actions within an RRI framework that may be adopted by the ICT community and how it might be embedded and de- ployed within current organizational processes. In order to address these questions, we conducted investigations from 2011 to 2013 with ICT research- ers in the U.K. among research funders, professional organizations, industry, and civil society organizations into the ways RRI concepts, tools, and process- es might become a creative resource for innovation in ICT. Our work was part of the Framework for Responsible Re- search and Innovation in ICT project funded by the Engineering and Physi- cal Sciences Research Council (EPSRC, https://www.epsrc.ac.uk/) in the U.K. The ICT Community Landscape We interviewed leading computer sci- entists, researchers, and postdoctoral RRI proposes a more reflective and inclusive research and innovation process, from fundamental research through to application design. 66 COMMUNICATIONS OF THE ACM | MAY 2017 | VOL. 60 | NO. 5 contributed articles ICT cannot be realized in a prescriptive manner. The nuances of acceptability and desirability and competing inter- ests and their embedding in social, eco- nomic, and political structures mean that many aspects of ICT are likely to remain contested for the foreseeable future. RRI cannot therefore expect to establish universal definitions of what counts as responsible but instead needs to be understood as a contextual process that facilitates development of sensitivities toward relevant issues and a willingness of stakeholders to en- gage with one another, making them responsive to mutual needs and inter- ests. We frame RRI for ICT as an ongo- ing cultural dialogue in which multiple voices from within the HCI community talk to RRI proponents in order to find ways of translating back and forth what forms of responsible ICT design and development might already be avail- able, be under development, or have yet to be developed. This approach is akin to the view asserted by Strand et al.20 who developed a set of indica- tors for the European Commission that could be used to monitor RRI across different disciplines, research themes, and projects. While proposing a com- prehensive list of indicators, Strand et al. also suggested that any indicator set would ultimately need to be (re)devel- oped in a given research or application context. Our framework is thus self-crit- ical by design and meant to be continu- ously challenged and adjusted. We exemplify what such a dynamic and context-sensitive framework for responsible behavior might include for ICT. Our EPSRC-funded study fo- cused on interviewees’ comments re- garding the difficulty of predicting ICT trajectories. While we regard this as appropriate skepticism in the overall RRI discourse, under “anticipation” of socio-technical futures we also suggest different approaches that consider the possible futures their innovation may bring about (such as a collaborative quest for future solutions informed by current experiences). This alterna- tive view profits from existing ICT re- search; that is, ICT researchers have much to add to the RRI discourse to make it more context-specific and use- ful. Reeves’s analysis16 of “envisioning” techniques is a case in point, making ing risks and uncertainties in comput- er science to that in the physical and life sciences. For example, researchers participating in our study discussed what we refer to as the “rhythm of ICT” whereby outputs may occur at a quick- er pace than in the physical sciences. Software may be developed, released, and go viral potentially on the same day with little, if any, oversight and have far-reaching effects on human ac- tivities and societal structures. These concerns relate to the “process” of re- search and innovation. A further distinguishing feature typical of ICT is what Johnson11 called “the problem of many hands,” or or- ganizational and institutional reliance on a division of labor whereby most activities are split among numerous in- dividuals. The problem becomes more fraught beyond organizational bound- aries when trying to conduct open source projects. Moreover, different disciplinary languages are significant, making interdisciplinary work that much more important but difficult to achieve in practice. Ascribing account- ability for eventual consequences is therefore difficult. These aspects of ICT projects point to the importance of considering what we call the “people dimension” of RRI in ICT. A final concern that emerged from our study is the notion of “conver- gence” 9 whereby the increasingly per- vasive nature of technologies in the age of the Internet, Web 2.0, and pervasive computing means that demarcating clear boundaries among systems, fea- tures, and functionality is increasing- ly problematic. Blurring boundaries means it becomes progressively more difficult to discern the “purpose” of ICT research and innovation. These concerns pose a significant challenge to RRI in ICT that may go beyond those in other fields. We thus developed the “4 Ps,” or product, proc- ess, people, and purpose, outlined earlier, as well as other concepts and approaches to be explained next, to develop a framework for RRI specific to ICT. Toward AREA Plus The AREA acronym refers to general points of interest in RRI, but more detail is needed for ICT research. The discussion so far has shown that RRI in Fundamental problems include the fact that research and innovation do not follow linear and predictable patterns. MAY 2017 | VOL. 60 | NO. 5 | COMMUNICATIONS OF THE ACM 67 contributed articles However, closures may still leave room for diversity. 19 In sum, certain forms of practical self-reflection and self-criticism ex- ist in ICT research and could be cul- tivated further under the extended AREA Plus framework. In this sense, EPSRC’s original AREA principles are clear that the social shaping of tech- nologies is at the heart of computer sci- ence, not external to it, as suggested by some of the interviewees in our study. Visions, utopia, predictions, promises, and hype have been produced for de- cades concerning how socio-technical futures may unfold, though much of it has been done rather unconsciously, thus shaping the trajectories of ICT in ways that shut down alternative paths. There are thus implicit human and technological powers at play. Narra- tives, teleology, and technological de- terminism proliferate but are not suf- ficiently reflected. In practical terms, our framework draws on such existing approaches to ICT development and provides a variety of scaffolding questions. Each aspect of the framework expands into deeper questions, suggesting literature, more detailed discussion, and problemati- zation of a particular aspect of ICT in- novation. For instance, after scanning the framework as a whole (see Figure 1) a researcher might want to consider to what extent the effects of ICT develop- ment may be anticipated (see Figure 2 and Figure 3). Various links between approaches provide questions for ex- ploring different possible pathways, a more comprehensive line of reasoning, and references. Our framework is meant to be adapted to the context in which re- searchers and other stakeholders find themselves. The idea is to productively “open up” not “close down” expert dis- course. 19 At the same time, we do not question “closure” per se. Any design- and-development process requires tak- ing countless decisions and translat- ing them into software and hardware solutions at multiple points in time. Figure 1. The AREA Plus framework.

To what extent are we able to anticipate the final product, future uses, and impact? The future cannot be predicted with certainty, but there is room for exploring different possible pathways. Also, researchers and other stakeholders can build on existing formal and informal practices of anticipation in the ICT community. Exploring different possible pathways ˲ Who might be the intended audience(s) of the envisioned product? ˲ What is the context the envisioned product is meant to address? And what is the context in which this anticipation process itself is taking place? ˲ What current issues does the anticipation process target or could target? ˲ What can we learn from earlier (historical) anticipation processes? ˲ In pursuing a particular vision, what pathways might we also be shutting down? And what endpoints and current issues might be excluded? (Scaffolding questions adopted and adapted from Reeves 16) Envisioning in ICT As in Reeves, 16 although it is difficult to predict the trajectory of ICT innovations, including out- comes, future uses, and impacts, ICT is a domain in which vision, utopia, predictions, promises, and hype have been produced for decades. Much of it has been done rather unconsciously, thus shaping the trajectories of ICT in ways that shut down alternative paths. Implicit powers are also at play. Narratives, teleology, and technological determinism proliferate but are not sufficiently reflected. 68 COMMUNICATIONS OF THE ACM | MAY 2017 | VOL. 60 | NO. 5 contributed articles as a strategic concern would facilitate practices of anticipation, reflection, and engagement to occur in the forma- tion of new research programs by fund- ing councils and in the final stages of commercialization at the academic/ commercial interfaces where aca- demic and commercial interests most visibly overlap and sometimes col- lide. In between these poles a respon- sible research and innovation process would incorporate the roles of funding councils, professional bodies, and oth- ers in sustaining RRI practices within research teams by providing appropri- ate support, services, and guidance. Responsible behavior thus becomes a collective, unpredictable activity, less about accountability and liability, and more about care and responsiveness to the public. 18 There is evidence that these devel- opments are under way. Academia and industry are starting to be aware of RRI for many reasons. Maybe the best of them, and a good conclusion for this article, is that RRI, while largely conceived as a risk-management ap- proach to socio-technical change, has a much more positive trajectory than simply constraining innovation to mitigate risk. By incorporating active considerations of alternate socio-tech- nical futures into design, engaging with stakeholders, reflecting on proc- ess, product, and purpose, and putting people at the center of research and in- novation, RRI may well provide inspi- ration and become a unique source of innovation and creativity.

Future AREA Plus Framework The framework we started to develop in 2011, as explained earlier in this article, is not a panacea and cannot perform miracles. Many questions of relevance concerning ICT projects are related to fundamentally opposing concerns and socially and politically contested interests. Such conflicts will not disappear overnight. However, the framework may allow researchers and innovators to better understand their own and others’ positions and con- tribute to better-informed debate and higher-quality policies and decisions. Much remains to be done to achieve this vision of responsible technology development and support its progress. The framework needs to be supported by effective tools and specific guid- ance on particular topics, issues, and technologies. The web-based resource we developed to provide them (http:// www.orbit-rri.org/) is only a starting point. We next identify concerns that are crucial to the further development and adoption of the framework. First, embedding RRI activities needs to be perceived by research- ers as something achievable. As we explained earlier, “anticipation” be- comes significantly less mysterious when realistically scoped and ground- ed in concrete practices, including specific envisioning techniques and questions. Implementing RRI is about finding ways to instantiate concrete achievable practices and not about unattainable ideals of “perfect” fore- sight or “risk-free” innovation. Also, RRI for ICT may require developing new initiatives that are likely to de- pend on more fine-grain case studies beyond the scope of this article. In addition, an integrated approach to RRI is needed for the successful adoption of the framework. RRI has to be sensitive to the relationships among researchers, practitioners, and the hierarchies and organizational struc- tures in which they are situated. Re- sponsibilities need to be apportioned across the entire ecology of organiza- tions that together deliver research and innovation.8 Taking RRI seriously","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
