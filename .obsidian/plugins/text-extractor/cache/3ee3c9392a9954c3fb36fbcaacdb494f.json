What is a Requirement? 1. A need perceived by a stakeholder. 2. A capability or property that a system shall have. 3. A documented representation of a need, capability or property. 5M. Glinz: A Glossary of Requirements Engineering Terminology, v1.6, IREB, 2014 Give some examples of requirements for a web search engine User/Stakeholder Requirements 6 User/Stakeholder Requirement User or Stakeholder requirements express stakeholders’ desires and needs that shall be satisfied by building a system, seen from the stakeholders’ perspective. [IREB] Example The Corona app shall track contacts by means of random IDs and should store them locally for two weeks. Example If a user has a positive test result, he or she can inform tracked contacts about their increased risk by means of a QR code. User/Stakeholder requirements document (Lastenheft) System description from user’s point of view. What? For what? (Was?, Wofür?) 7 “The most important property of a program is whether it accomplishes the intention of its user.” – Tony Hoare System Requirements 8 System Requirement System requirements describe how a system shall work and behave – as observed at the interface between the system and its environment – so that the system satisfies its stakeholders’ desires and needs. In the case of pure software systems, we speak of software requirements. [IREB] Example If two devices are within a range of 2m for at least 15 minutes, they exchange their IDs via Bluetooth. Example After two devices have exchanged their IDs, the devices shall store the IDs for two weeks. System requirements document (Pflichtenheft) System description from technical point of view. How? Whereby? (Wie?, Womit?) Example A device generates an ID every 24 hours and stores old IDs for two weeks. Functional Requirements 9 Functional Requirement Functional requirements concern a result or behavior that shall be provided by a function of a system. This includes requirements for data or the interaction of a system with its environment. [IREB] Example If a user has a positive test result, he or she can inform tracked contacts about their increased risk by means of a QR code. Example After IDs have been exchanged, the devices store them for two weeks. Quality Requirements 10 Quality Requirement “Quality requirements pertain to a quality concern that is not covered by functional requirements such as performance, availability, security, or reliability” [IREB] Example The delay between pressing a button and showing the next screen shall be < 0.1 sec. Example The app shall be easy to use. Note often more critical than functional requirements Example The app shall be available 99.999% of the time Example The app must not disclose any sensitive data. Functional vs. Quality Requirements ▪ Popular distinction: ▪ Functional requirements define what the system shall do ▪ Quality requirements define how the system shall do it The customer entry form shall contain fields for the customer’s name and first name, taking up to 32 characters per field, displaying at least 24 characters, left-bound, with a 12 pt. sanserif font. Functional requirement → but contains a lot about the how. The system shall process measurement data produced by the detector of a high- energy particle accelerator in real time. Performance requirement → but without, the system would not function at all ▪ Distinction not so obvious especially if requirements are very detailed or quality requirements are essential for the system ISO 25010 Quality Model Functional requirements Constraints 13 Constraint “A requirement that limits the solution space beyond what is necessary for meeting the given functional requirements and quality requirements.” [IREB] (Rahmenbedingungen) Example The app must be written in Swift. Note Constraints come directly from a stakeholder (not under control of the system designers) Example The source code of the app must be open source. Example Data collection must conform to GDPR (DSGVO). Constraints vs. other system requirements The systems must… vs. the system shall… Process and Project Requirements 14 Process Requirement Process requirements prescribe activities to be performed by the developing organization. For instance, process requirements could specify the methodologies that must be followed, and constraints that the organization must obey. Example Every code change must be reviewed by at least one member of the team. Example Every change request must be approved by the change control board. Project Requirement Project requirements are conditions or tasks that must be completed to ensure the success or completion of the project. They provide a clear picture of the work that needs to be done. They're meant to align the project's resources with the objectives of the organization. Example A first version of the app shall be released on May 01, 2024. Example The costs for development shall not exceed 0.5 Mio. Euro. Requirements Types 15M. Glinz: On Non-functional Requirements, RE, 2007 Sometimes called “non-functional requirements“ Stakeholders, Vision, and Scope Stakeholder ▪ A person or organization who influences a system’s requirements or who is impacted by that system. ▪ Characteristics ▪ Power/Influence ▪ Interest ▪ Possibility to influence ▪ Attitude (pos. vs. neg.) ▪ Internal, partner, external ▪ The user is always a stakeholder 17 keep satisfied monitor keep informed manage closely Interest System Vision: What? ▪ The system vision is a joint vision of the system agreed upon all active stakeholders ▪ Characteristics ▪ Big Picture ▪ Abstract ▪ Rich context ▪ Focus on impact ▪ Purpose ▪ Agreement on what is the project about ▪ Easy communication with stakeholders (incl. developers) ▪ Validation and elicitation of new aspects System Vision: How? ▪ A system vision text should contain the following ingredients: ▪ Problem: What are problems in a certain context. What are the reasons? How severe are the problems? ▪ Solution: What is the core idea to solve the problem ▪ Value: What is the added value of the solution? What is different with the solution? System vision of the Corona Warn App: The aim of the Corona-Warn-App is to identify SARS-CoV-2 chains of infection as quickly as possible and to break them. It does this by rapidly and reliably notifying people that they have had contact with infected persons and therefore may have been exposed to the virus. These individuals can then self-isolate, to help stop the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. https://github.com/corona-warn-app/cwa-documentation/blob/master/scoping_document.md Short! A few sentences to one page max System Scope 20 System System Context Users External Systems System Boundary Context Boundary Irrelevant Environment Digital Services Physical Devices System Interface Stakeholder Processes Documents (laws, regulations, old requirements) System Scope ▪ Elements within the context of a system are sources of requirements ▪ Each requirement must be justified by a context element ▪ The justification is called the requirement’s rationale ▪ The system boundary determines what is part of the system-under- development and what is part of the environment that has a relation to the system ▪ The context boundary distinguishes the relevant from the irrelevant parts of the environment ▪ The system interface determines the interaction possibilities with elements in the context at runtime ▪ System boundary, context boundary, and interface may change over time 21How to structure requirements? Requirements Work Products ▪ Requirements are documented in requirements specifications ▪ There may be requirements specifications on different requirements level 23 User / Stakeholder requirements System requirements Business requirements Component A requirements Component B requirements Component C requirements Requirements Work Products ▪ Requirements documents summarize and structure requirements from different levels of abstraction ▪ Requirements document templates provide guidelines how to structure requirements documents ▪ A unified structure eases readability ▪ Predefined sections ensure that you don’t forget anything ▪ Requirements document templates ▪ Generic (e.g., ISO 29148) ▪ Domain-specific ▪ Company-specific ▪ Project-specific 24 ISO 29148: Requirements Documents Templates 25 Stakeholder Requirements Specification System Requirements Specification Software Requirements Specification What is Requirements Engineering? What is Requirements Engineering? A systematic and disciplined approach to the specification and management of requirements with the following goals: ▪ Knowing all relevant requirements ▪ Achieving a consensus among the stakeholders about these requirements ▪ Documenting requirements appropriately ▪ Managing requirements systematically ▪ Synonyms: Requirements Analysis, Requirements Management, Business Analysis, Business Process Analysis, Requirements Specification,… M. Glinz: A Glossary of Requirements Engineering Terminology, v1.6, IREB, 2014 28 Requirements Engineering is where the informal meets the formal – Michael Jackson There is not only one RE method! ▪ “Classical” RE ▪ Result: A requirements specification (document) ▪ Basis for contracting and implementation ▪ Typical in customer/supplier situations ▪ “Agile” RE ▪ Result: Product backlog, user stories, epics, … ▪ Basis for sprint planning ▪ Typical in most “in-house” SW development projects ▪ “Change-based” RE ▪ Result: Issues, Tickets, Change Requests,… ▪ Basis for product maintenance and evolution ▪ Typical in many “long-lived systems” ▪ “Code-based” RE ▪ Results: Code comments, manpages, mailing lists,… ▪ Basis for understanding and changing code ▪ Typical in open source projects 29 RE Impact 30 Why to write down requirements? Consolidation Contracting Development Cost Estimation Testing Cross-project/product Challenges of RE (in practice) Naming the Pain in RE – Top 10 RE Problems 1. Incomplete and/or hidden requirements 2. Communication flaws between project team and customer 3. Moving targets (changing goals, business processes and/or requirements) 4. Underspecified requirements that are too abstract 5. Time boxing / Not enough time in general 6. Communication flaws within the project team 7. Stakeholders with difficulties in separating requirements from known solution designs 8. Insufficient support by customer 9. Inconsistent requirements 10.Weak access to customer needs and/or business information 32D. Mendez Fernandez et al.: Naming the Pain in Requirements Engineering: Contemporary Problems, Causes, and Effects in Practice, 2016 Top 10 Causes for RE Problems 1. Lack of time 2. Lack of experience of RE team members 3. Weak qualification of RE team members 4. Communication flaws between project team and the customer 5. Requirements remain too abstract 6. Changing business needs 7. Customer does not know what he wants 8. Missing direct communication to customer 9. Language barriers 10.Strict time schedule by customer 33D. Mendez Fernandez et al.: Naming the Pain in Requirements Engineering: Contemporary Problems, Causes, and Effects in Practice, 2016 Causes, Effects and Project Success 34D. Mendez Fernandez et al.: Naming the Pain in Requirements Engineering: Contemporary Problems, Causes, and Effects in Practice, 2016 Why is RE so Challenging? ▪ Much RE has no value per se ▪ It is not the requirements engineer who directly profits from good RE work ▪ Complete and unambiguous requirements specifications are an illusion ▪ RE is not just about SW but about humans, systems, and processes → As little as possible, as much as needed → Work value-oriented and risk-driven → Create and ensure common understanding → Cooperation over confrontation and contracts. 35","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
