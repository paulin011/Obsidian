Weber Lan Yao This article studies socially responsible behavior in markets. We develop a laboratory product market in which low-cost production creates a negative ex- ternality for third parties, but where alternative production with higher costs mitigates the externality. Our ﬁrst study, conducted in Switzerland, reveals a persistent preference among many consumers and ﬁrms for avoiding negative social impact in the market, reﬂected both in the composition of product types and in a price premium for socially responsible products. Socially responsible behavior is generally robust to varying market characteristics, such as in- creased seller competition and limited consumer information, and it responds to prices in a manner consistent with a model in which positive social impact is a utility-enhancing feature of a consumer product. In a second study, we inves- tigate whether market social responsibility varies across societies by comparing market behavior in Switzerland and China. While subjects in Switzerland and China do not differ in their degree of social concern in nonmarket contexts, we ﬁnd that low-cost production that creates negative externalities is signiﬁcantly more prevalent in markets in China. Across both studies, consumers in markets exhibit less social concern than subjects in a comparable individual choice con- text. JEL Codes: C92, D03, D62, M14. I. Introduction Adam Smith’s metaphor of the invisible hand illustrates the idea that decentralized interaction of independent actors, through market exchange, leads to efﬁcient allocation of re- sources. In fact, there exists widespread evidence that markets often fulﬁll this function. However, unregulated market ex- change is also often blamed as a source of social ills, including *We are grateful to two editors, Lawrence Katz and Andrei Shleifer, and three anonymous referees for helpful suggestions that improved the article.

Indeed, returning to the efﬁcacy of the invisible hand, an important underlying condition is the absence of negative exter- nalities. When the social costs of market activity are not borne by the trading parties in the market—as in the foregoing examples— then markets can systematically underappreciate such impacts, absent some other channel through which they are incorporated. Hence, a standard response to the problem of external effects is to call for an active role for government in regulating or taxing ac- tivities that impose externalities. An alternative remedy occurs if market participants volun- tarily internalize the social impacts of their actions. Firms may voluntarily incur additional production costs to limit negative environmental impacts, as reﬂected in Apple CEO Tim Cook’s statement to shareholders that the ﬁrm does ‘‘a lot of things for reasons besides proﬁt motive. We want to leave the world better than we found it’’ (Politi 2014). However, the extent to which such acts reﬂect true concern for social impact, rather than for ﬁrm reputation and long-term proﬁts, is unclear. At the same time, consumers may be willing to pay higher prices for products that mitigate social harm. Several studies document such willingness (Roe et al. 2001; Johnston et al. 2001; Louriero, McCluskey, and Mittelhammer 2001; De Pelsmacker, Driesen, and Rayp 2005), though these results are typically from hypothetical choice or willingness-to-pay measures or from comparisons of purchasing behavior over distinct market products that may differ in dimen- sions beyond social impact, such as actual or perceived quality. Thus, although the notion of individual and corporate social responsibility—a willingness to sacriﬁce proﬁts or wealth in pur- suit of broader social interest—has recently come into focus as a means to prevent efﬁciency losses due to external effects (Be´nabou and Tirole 2010),1 the extent to which this presents an actual remedy for negative impacts of market activity remains 1. This notion is, however, not new to economics. For example, Arrow called ‘‘attention to a less visible form of social action: norms of social behavior, including ethical and moral codes’’ and suggested ‘‘as one possible interpretation that they are reactions of society to compensate for market failures’’ (1970, p. 22). QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS220 to be better understood. The presence of product labels such as ‘‘carbon-free,’’ ‘‘fair trade,’’ and ‘‘cruelty-free’’ in consumer prod- uct markets—often associated with higher production costs for ﬁrms and prices for consumers—suggests a potential inﬂuence of concerns for social impact on market activity. But in real prod- uct markets it is difﬁcult to isolate social responsibility from other possible motives underlying production and consumption of such products.2 To address this issue, we report two laboratory studies that explore the extent to which socially responsible market behavior can mitigate the problem of negative external effects. Our para- digm models a competitive product market, in which sellers decide on a price and on which type of product they want to offer for sale—either one that produces a negative externality for a third party or one that does not, with the latter involving higher production costs. Consumers choose which offered product to buy or whether to buy a product at all. We allow repetition to observe outcomes that arise with experience in the market. The standard equilibrium prediction for these markets is that only the cheaper good, which produces the externality, is traded. In contrast to this prediction, a baseline condition from our ﬁrst study—conducted in Switzerland—ﬁnds that markets con- verge rapidly to a stable outcome in which a signiﬁcant propor- tion (roughly 45%) of products traded cost more to produce but yield no externality. The prices for such goods are regularly higher than prices for externality-producing products, though to a lesser extent than the additional production cost. Thus, in our markets, sellers and buyers share, on average, the burden for preventing negative externalities. We interpret these ﬁndings as evidence that fair or moral behavior can persist in competitive market exchange. One goal of our research is to study how varying factors affect the prevalence of socially responsible market behavior. Real markets sometimes fail to internalize externalities, as with wide- spread instances of pollution, whereas in other cases they appear to reﬂect greater concern for social impacts. The extent to which 2. The possibility that market participants voluntarily internalize external costs is also consistent with evidence that decision makers in nonmarket contexts regularly demonstrate concern for the external impacts of their actions (Hoffman et al. 1994; Andreoni and Miller 2002; Fisman, Kariv, and Markovits 2007; Cappelen et al. 2007). DO MARKETS ERODE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY? 221 market participants internalize social impacts thus varies and may be inﬂuenced by factors such as market characteristics, pro- duction technologies, and culture. Therefore, we study the robust- ness of social responsibility, starting from the level we observe in the baseline market condition with subjects in Switzerland. First, we study the effect of increased seller competition, by adding supramarginal ﬁrms to the market, which should theoret- ically have no effect. However, increased competition might diminish fairness concerns (Roth et al. 1991) and, more broadly, is often considered a potentially corrupting inﬂuence in market behavior (Shleifer 2004; Cai and Liu 2009; Brandts, Riedl, and van Winden 2009). In our market, increased competition drives down overall prices, thus yielding greater relative surplus for consumers. But increased competition does not diminish the degree of concern exhibited toward externality-bearing parties outside of the market. Second, we consider the possibility that consumers may have limited information about which ﬁrms’ products are socially harmful, but that such information is often available if a con- sumer chooses to acquire it. In a setting where consumers are initially uninformed about the types of the offered products, we study both a case in which the information about external impact is free and one in which acquiring it involves the consumer incur- ring a small cost. In both cases, we ﬁnd that the informational default has only a small effect—though slightly larger when ac- quiring information is costly—on the expression of social respon- sibility in the market. Third, we study the effect of an alternative production tech- nology under which the cost of externality-free production is con- siderably higher. In our baseline market condition, this cost equals 20% of the surplus created for ﬁrms and consumers through exchange. We compare this with a condition in which ﬁrms and consumers must forgo 80% of this surplus to avoid im- posing the externality. In this case, the market share of the so- cially responsible product decreases signiﬁcantly, by about half, though this lower market share nevertheless remains stable throughout the experiment. This ﬁnding indicates that market participants respond to economic factors in deciding whether to act socially responsibly and provides a basis for understanding why the share of socially responsible trade is higher in some mar- kets than others. QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS222 To better understand the nature of preferences for social responsibility, we estimate choice models of consumer and ﬁrm behavior from our experimental data. For consumers, we esti- mate a conditional logit choice model (McFadden 1974) in which utility is determined by both a consumer’s own material payoff and the social impact of a product purchase. We ﬁnd that choices made by consumers in all market conditions demonstrate concern for both sources of utility, and this concern is fairly stable. Thus, positive social impact can be modeled as a utility-enhancing prod- uct attribute that consumers compare to products’ relative prices. We also study ﬁrms’ product supply decisions, and ﬁnd that ﬁrms, on average, respond sensibly to the expected relative proﬁtability of the two types of products, but their behavior also exhibits per- sistence, among some ﬁrms, in producing socially responsible products. Hence, the experimental conditions generally reveal signiﬁ- cant and stable levels of socially responsible behavior in markets conducted in Switzerland. However, it is also important to iden- tify the robustness of such behavior in other populations, parti- cularly across societies with varying cultural values, market practices, and historical trajectories in economic development. To this end, we report a second study, in which we compare so- cially responsible market behavior in our subject pool in Switzerland and a comparable subject pool in China. Concerns about social impact, such as environmental damage, are ubiqui- tous in discussions of China’s rapidly growing economy; relatedly, there is debate regarding whether market behavior in China reﬂects less concern for morality and responsibility than in ad- vanced Western economies (Ip 2009). Indeed, survey evidence suggests that notions of what constitutes ‘‘fair’’ behavior in mar- kets may differ between Chinese and Western responders, with Chinese responses often judging deceitful and harmful business conduct less harshly (Ahmed, Chung, and Eichenseher 2003; Lee et al. 2009; Gao 2009; Wong, Long, and Elankumaran 2010). However, to our knowledge, no empirical data directly test whether the behavior of Chinese market participants exhibits less concern for social responsibility. Hence, our second study implements a replication of our baseline market in Zurich and in Shanghai. In Switzerland, we almost exactly replicate the market share of the socially responsible product (48%). In China, however, this market share is much lower, at 16%. DO MARKETS ERODE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY? 223 The data thus reveal much less social responsibility in the exper- imental markets in China than in Switzerland. We also implement an experimental nonmarket condition, in which individuals in Switzerland and China make identical allo- cation choices, affecting themselves and two other participants, absent any market context. Consistent with prior research that ﬁnds no systematic differences when comparing prosocial behav- iors in nonmarket contexts for Chinese and Western subjects (Buchan, Johnson, and Croson 2006; Chuah et al. 2007; Bohnet et al., 2008; Herrmann, Tho¨ni, and Ga¨ chter 2008), we ﬁnd no differences in the nonmarket context. This suggests that norms of socially responsible market behavior are weaker in our subject population in China than in Switzerland—even though the mea- sured propensity to act prosocially outside of markets does not differ. Finally, to address the debate whether markets ‘‘corrupt’’ concern for social impact, we include conditions in both studies that allow us to directly compare the strength of the social con- cern exhibited by individual participants in our market environ- ment with social concern expressed in a comparable dictator-like choice context. More precisely, we take choices faced by con- sumers in our baseline market condition and present exactly the same choices, without the market context but with identical monetary consequences for the decision maker and for two other participants, to a new group of participants. Across three comparisons—one from each study in Switzerland and one from Study 2 in China—the frequency of choices mitigating the negative social impact on third parties in this nonmarket context is higher than in the market context, though the difference is smaller in Switzerland than in China. These observations are qualitatively in line with recent arguments that markets erode socially responsible behavior, relative to nonmarket contexts (e.g., Falk and Szech 2013), though our ﬁndings also indicate that social concern may be more robust to market contexts in some populations than in others. The remainder of the article is structured as follows. Section II reviews related literature. Section III describes the experimen- tal design of our ﬁrst study, conducted in Switzerland. Section IV presents the market shares and prices for the two types of prod- ucts, and Section V presents analyses of individual ﬁrm and con- sumer behavior. Section VI contains the design and results of our second study, comparing socially responsible behavior in QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS224 Switzerland and China. Section VII uses the combined data from both studies to compare consumer market behavior to individual allocation choices in comparable nonmarket contexts. Section VIII concludes. II. Related Literature An extensive literature shows that experimental markets generally converge to equilibrium predictions in which consider- ations such as fairness have minimal impact, even when one side of the market captures all of the surplus (Smith 1962; Plott and Smith 1978; Smith and Williams 1982; Roth et al. 1991; Holt 1995; Franciosi et al. 1995) and when product purchases create negative externalities for other market participants (Plott 1983). Although these data are often interpreted as evidence that social considerations are minimally important in markets, a key dis- tinction between this and our work is that the kind of social impact we study deals not with fairness or inequality among di- rectly interacting market participants—such as ﬁrms and consumers—but with concern for individuals entirely uninvolved with the market exchange process. This is the case, for example, when production and exchange yield widespread negative social impacts, such as environmental pollution, or harm to those unable to exert agency, as with labor coercion or animal testing. Our experiments ﬁnd that concerns for such social impact can be persistently manifested in market behavior. Our results also relate to a prominent argument that market exchange crowds out moral values (e.g., Sandel 2012).3 Much of the evidence supporting this argument, however, is indirect and does not study the behavior of individuals interacting in markets. For example, experimental ﬁndings reveal that framing a nonmarket interaction with market terminology can reduce the importance of moral considerations among interacting partici- pants (Hoffman et al. 1994; Ross and Ward 1996; Cappelen, Sørensen, and Tungodden 2013). Similarly, the act of assigning monetary value to ‘‘good’’ behaviors, through prices, can crowd out intrinsic motivations for such acts (Frey, Oberholzer-Gee, and Eichenberger 1996; Gneezy and Rustichini 2000; Mellstro¨m and 3. A distinct argument is that the properties of markets make moral consid- erations indistinguishable from other motivations under certain conditions govern- ing exchange (Sobel 2010; Dufwenberg et al. 2011). DO MARKETS ERODE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY? 225 Johannesson 2008). Moreover, priming people to think of money, in contrast to similar nonmonetary primes, leads to more individ- ualistic and less prosocial behavior (Vohs, Meade, and Goode 2006; see also Kube, Mare´chal, and Puppe 2012). Thus, while there is considerable indirect evidence that suggests a perverting effect of market exchange, there is little direct evidence on whether moral considerations are truly eroded by market interaction. One exception is Falk and Szech (2013), who show that re- peated interaction in bilateral and multilateral double-auction markets yields less socially responsible behavior than one-shot nonmarket decisions, measured by individuals’ willingness to accept 10 euros for the death of a mouse. However, comparing only the extent to which outcomes that produce negative social impacts are generated by market and nonmarket contexts, the results of Falk and Szech show a limited negative impact of markets.4 Moreover, Falk and Szech’s comparison of market and nonmarket decision making changes several aspects of the choice context simultaneously, making it difﬁcult to interpret whether the change results from aspects unique to market versus nonmarket comparisons.5 Finally, and perhaps most im- portant, Falk and Szech’s markets have only one production tech- nology, which necessarily requires the imposition of a negative externality if exchange occurs. However, many real-world mar- kets are characterized by a multiplicity of production technolo- gies, some of which create fewer negative externalities than others. Indeed, a valuable aspect of markets is that where a pref- erence to employ a technology that limits external harm exists, market incentives and competition can encourage its adoption. Hence, our design allows social responsibility to be manifested in market exchange—as long as the trading parties are willing to bear the necessary costs. Thus, an important contribution of our work is to highlight the valuable role markets can play in 4. In Falk and Szech’s individual (nonmarket) condition, 45.9% of subjects accept a 10 euro payment that kills a mouse, whereas in a bilateral market, 47.7% of possible trades that cause a mouse’s death occur. Both of these proportions are similar to the frequencies of social harm that we observe across many market conditions in our experiments. See also Breyer and Weimann (2014) for further discussion of Falk and Szech’s data. 5. For example, the nonmarket treatment involves a one-shot decision, with- out feedback, that unilaterally determines social outcomes, while the market con- text involves repeated decisions, with feedback on others’ behavior, in which parties jointly determine outcomes and responsibility is therefore diffused. QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS226 generating socially responsible alternatives to harmful prod- ucts—provided a feasible technology for doing so. Our ﬁndings also relate to research showing that markets and social concerns are compatible. For example, Henrich et al. (2001, 2010) ﬁnd that exposure of developing societies to market interaction facilitates the adoption of prosocial norms. Our stud- ies show directly that behavior consistent with such norms can persist as a feature of market exchange. In this sense, our work also relates to the literature showing that efﬁciency-enhancing reciprocity between buyers and sellers can persist in markets with incomplete contracts (Fehr, Kirchsteiger, and Riedl 1993; Fehr and Falk 1999). Although the nature of these results is dis- tinct from our work, in which contracts between buyers and sell- ers are complete, we establish the similar ﬁnding that social considerations can persist in competitive markets. Finally, our second experiment relates to work that measures differences in preferences and behavior between Chinese and Western individuals in nonmarket contexts (Buchan, Johnson, and Croson 2006; Chuah et al. 2007; Bohnet et al. 2008; Herrmann, Tho¨ni, and Ga¨chter 2008). 6 This work shows that Chinese subjects tend to be generally no less prosocial than Western subjects—if anything, they may be slightly more proso- cial. Close to our work are survey studies that document differing perceptions between Chinese and Western respondents regarding what constitutes ethical behavior in markets (Ahmed, Chung, and Eichenseher 2003; Lee et al. 2009; Wong, Long, and Elankumaran 2010). For example, Gao (2009) analyzes survey responses col- lected in China and Switzerland using Kahneman, Knetsch, and Thaler’s (1986) vignettes describing market behavior and eliciting judgments of the fairness or unfairness of the behavior, ﬁnding that Chinese respondents often rate egoistic market behaviors less harshly than do respondents in Switzerland and Canada. 7 6. A related paper (Kachelmeier and Shehata 1992) compares laboratory be- havior in China and the United States in double-auction markets with highly asym- metric equilibrium proﬁts. Markets in both countries converge to equilibrium prices. Hence, the tendency for markets to eliminate concerns for equality between buyers and sellers, which we reviewed earlier, is present in China as well as in the United States. 7. For example, for a scenario in which a landlord exploits a tenant’s inability to move to raise the rent, 91% of Canadian respondents in the original study judged the behavior as unfair, 92% of Swiss respondents did so, while only 63% of Chinese nonstudents and 80% of Chinese students did so. DO MARKETS ERODE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY? 227 Our study provides an empirical complement, by testing whether such perceptions are reﬂected in the behavior of participants in competitive markets. III. Study 1: Experimental Design III.A. The Market Game Our design develops a novel experimental market environ- ment that contains important features of real-world product mar- kets. Firms and consumers can exchange two types of products, one of which imposes a negative externality on a third party. For simplicity, we label the product that produces no externality (e ¼ 0), the socially responsible product, as the ‘‘fair’’ product and the product that generates a negative externality (e ¼ 1) as the ‘‘unfair’’ product. Both product types are worth 50 to the consumer. The pro- duction cost of the unfair product is normalized to 0, thus gener- ating a surplus of 50 to ﬁrms and consumers when exchanged. However, exchange of this product, which imposes a negative externality of 60 on a third party, is socially harmful and inefﬁ- cient, with a net welfare impact of 50 \u0002 60 ¼\u000210. In contrast, the fair product has a production cost of c 2ð0; 50Þ that is borne by the ﬁrm but has no impact on the third party. In most of our experimental conditions, c ¼ 10. In all cases, exchange of the fair product is efﬁcient, as it generates a net surplus of 50 \u0002 c > 0, which is greater than the net surplus of not trading (0) or of trad- ing the unfair product ð\u000210). Our Market Baseline condition consists of six ﬁrms, ﬁve con- sumers, and ﬁve third parties. All start with 100 units of wealth. Each ﬁrm offers a single product, either e ¼ 0or e ¼ 1, in a posted-offer market, at a price, p, determined by that ﬁrm. The cost to the ﬁrm of producing a fair product is c ¼ 10. After all ﬁrms select product types and prices, consumers enter the market sequentially in a randomly determined order, observe the current menu of prices and product types, and either choose a single product or reject all available offers. A ﬁrm can sell at most one product. Hence, while the consumer who enters the market ﬁrst can choose among all six product offers, consumers who enter later only see and choose from the remaining offers. Because there are six ﬁrms but only ﬁve consumers, even the last consumer entering the market can choose from at least two QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS228 product offers. There is, however, always at least one ﬁrm that cannot sell its product. Firms are informed about the product offers—type and price—of all ﬁrms in a period, the order in which offers are accepted, and thus also the offer(s) that remain unsold. The payoff of each of the ﬁve third parties is determined by one of the ﬁve possible market exchanges between ﬁrms and consumers. Speciﬁcally, the purchase of an unfair product by a consumer reduces a randomly selected third party’s payoff by 60 units, while either the purchase of a fair product or a consumer’s decision not to purchase any product yield no impact on the cor- responding third party’s payoff.

We eliminate the possibility of cross-period reputation by not showing subjects the ID numbers of other market participants and by randomly ordering the dis- play of product offers in each period. One round is randomly chosen for payment at the end of the experiment. Each third party is randomly matched to the purchasing decision realized by a particular consumer. We introduce an explicit market context in the instructions. Players A are described as ‘‘sellers’’ and Players B as ‘‘buyers’’ and they are told they can ‘‘trade’’ different ‘‘types of products’’ at the offered ‘‘prices.’’ Player C is neutrally described as Player C, and the two types of products are called ‘‘product without impact on 8. Note that the production costs (when e ¼ 0) and the externality (when e ¼ 1) arise only if a product is sold, which can be interpreted as a ‘‘production on demand’’ technology. We chose this design feature to create a situation in which exchange between buyers and sellers creates the externality.

An English translation of the original German in- structions for the Market Baseline condition is included in Online Appendix F. III.B. Varying Market and Technological Characteristics To study the robustness of socially responsible market behav- ior, Study 1 implements additional market variants, each of which changes one characteristic of the market. Speciﬁcally, we vary (i) the degree of competition between ﬁrms in the market, (ii) the information that consumers have about the types of available products, and (iii) the cost of becoming informed about the char- acteristics of products. Moreover, we also implement a variation in the production technology by (iv) increasing the production cost of the fair product. First, in a High Firm Competition condition, we increase the number of ﬁrms from six to eight. Apart from this difference, this condition is identical to the Market Baseline. We expect this in- creased competition between ﬁrms will lead to prices closer to competitive equilibrium than in the Market Baseline, as posted- offer markets typically yield prices above competitive equilibrium (Plott and Smith 1978). Our primary focus, however, is on how this increased competition affects social responsibility, for exam- ple, the market share of the fair product. Second, we conduct two Limited Information conditions, in which consumers initially have no information regarding the types of different products. Consumers initially only observe the price of each available product, though they are aware that the products might vary based on their social impact. In both conditions, consumers have the opportunity, in each period, to learn the social impact of all available products after observing the prices. If they decide not to acquire this information, they never become informed about the product types in that period, not even about the impact of any product they might pur- chase. The two conditions vary how costly it is for consumers to become informed. In the Limited Information (Free) condition, a consumer can reveal the product types at no monetary cost, sim- ply by clicking a button. Apart from the fact that consumers do not learn the types of products by default when entering the market, this condition is identical to the Market Baseline. However, it allows us to identify whether an alternative, QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS230 perhaps more natural informational default affects socially re- sponsible behavior and market outcomes. In the Limited Information (Costly) condition a consumer has to pay a small cost of 1 unit if she chooses to reveal the types of the available products before making a purchasing decision in a period. This adds the realistic feature that it is often (minimally) costly for consumers to become informed about the social impact of avail- able products. Finally, in the High Production Cost condition, we increase the production cost of the fair product to c ¼ 40, in contrast with the production cost of c ¼ 10 in the Market Baseline. The High Production Cost condition thus implements a technological change from the Market Baseline, in terms of the cost of mitigat- ing the externality, but is otherwise identical. III.C. The No Market Condition The foregoing experimental conditions all study the preva- lence of concern for social impact under varying market and tech- nological conditions. To provide a nonmarket benchmark against which to compare the degree of such concern, we conducted a No Market condition. This condition mimics standard distributional decision tasks (i.e., dictator games) typically used to measure concerns for fairness and social impact in individual choice experiments. Our novel design creates a precise parallel between the mon- etary consequences of the product choices made by consumers in a given round in the Market Baseline and the allocation choices made by decision makers in our No Market condition. To achieve this, we present each decision maker in the No Market condition with the exact sequence of choices faced by a yoked consumer in the Market Baseline. That is, for each consumer in the Market Baseline, who faced a sequence of 24 menus of product offers, we have a decision maker in the No Market condition who faces a sequence of 24 identical (in monetary terms) neutrally framed allocation choices. We implement three-person groups (Players A, B, and C), in which Player B (corresponding to consumers in our market con- ditions) chooses between different allocations of payoffs among all three players. Players A and C are thus inactive in this condition and correspond implicitly to the roles of ﬁrms and third parties in DO MARKETS ERODE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY? 231 the market condition.9 The assignment of subjects to roles is ﬁxed for the 24 rounds. As in the Market Baseline, one of the 24 rounds is randomly chosen to determine payoffs at the end of a session. Our design compares the behavior of individuals—in the roles of ‘‘consumers’’ or as neutrally framed decision makers— between market and nonmarket settings. Speciﬁcally, we aim to study the trade-offs people make between personal beneﬁts and the welfare of others in two very distinct and important set- tings: an individual choice context similar to the widely studied dictator game and a context designed to simulate consumer choice in product markets. For this purpose, we employ a design that allows us to identify differences in individuals’ pref- erences between the two contexts, measured by choices among consequentially identical sets of alternatives. By holding the monetary consequences of these choices constant while also keep- ing the choice procedures and interface very similar, our design creates a clear basis for this comparison, relative to one in which we change more features of the choice environments.10 III.D. Predictions The standard economic assumptions of self-interest and rationality yield the same prediction for all the market condi- tions: all consumers purchase the unfair product, which is traded at a price of zero. The resulting outcomes are maximally 9. For example, suppose a consumer in Market Baseline can choose between three different products: (i) one fair product at price, p ¼ 30; (ii) one fair product at price, p ¼ 25; and (iii) one unfair product at price, p ¼ 15. There is also always the option (iv) not to buy a product at all. Then, the corresponding four allocation op- tions for a Player B in the No Market condition are: (i) 120 for Player A (100 þ 30 \u0002 10), 120 for Player B (100 þ 50 \u0002 30), and 100 for Player C (100 \u0002 0); (ii) 115 for A (100 þ 25 \u0002 10), 125 for B (100 þ 50 \u0002 25), and 100 for C (100 \u0002 0); (iii) 115 for A (100 þ 15 \u0002 0), 135 for B (100 þ 50 \u0002 15), and 40 for C (100 \u0002 60); and (iv) 100 for each player. 10. For example, an alternative approach might compare our Market Baseline to a nonmarket condition in which a single subject plays the role of ﬁrm and con- sumer and can choose among all payoff combinations (price and product type) avail- able in our market setting. Such a design, by taking a decision collectively produced by multiple subjects (ﬁrms and consumers) and making it the responsibility of a single subject, would essentially test diffusion of responsibility. Extensive evidence documents that diffused responsibility signiﬁcantly decreases concern for social impact, even in contexts not involving markets (Darley and Latane, 1968; Dana, Weber, and Kuang 2007; Hamman, Loewenstein, and Weber 2010). QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS232 inefﬁcient, since each unit of the unfair good traded results in a net social loss. Our experiment also allows the possibility of socially respon- sible behavior, reﬂected in market shares and prices. If concern for social impact is a persistent characteristic of market partici- pants’ preferences, and such concern is sufﬁciently strong, then we expect positive and constant market shares for the fair product.11 III.E. General Information and Procedures All sessions took place at the computer laboratory of the Department of Economics at the University of Zurich. Subjects were mainly students from the University of Zurich and the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich. Students majoring in economics or psychology were not eligible to participate. Study 1 employed a total of 613 participants in a between-subjects design; that is, each subject participated in only one condition. Table I gives an overview of our treatment conditions and the number of observations. We conducted between six and seven independent markets for each market condition, each using between 96 and 112 subjects. We also conducted three sessions of the No Market condition, with 105 subjects. The study was conducted using the software z-Tree (Fischbacher 2007). Before entering the lab, each subject ran- domly drew a place card that speciﬁed at which computer termi- nal to sit. The terminal number determined a subject’s role. Subjects received written instructions, including comprehension questions that had to be answered correctly before a session began. An experimenter read a summary of the instructions 11. Online Appendix A provides a straightforward application of a standard model of social preferences (Fehr and Schmidt 1999) to our setting. The model predicts that consumers and ﬁrms sufﬁciently concerned with fairness and inequal- ity are willing to bear additional costs for socially responsible products that do not harm the third party. The model also predicts a decreased market share for the fair product as the cost of mitigating the externality, c, increases, but the predicted market share is insensitive to increased ﬁrm competition and costless limited in- formation (and also essentially insensitive to very small information costs). Research on social concern in nonmarket environments shows that many people exploit default informational states to act self-interestedly (Dana, Weber, and Kuang 2007). Although inconsistent with most social preference models, such be- havior raises the possibility that consumers with limited information will similarly exploit a state of default ignorance about product types. DO MARKETS ERODE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY? 233 aloud to ensure common information about actions, payoffs, and procedures. Sessions lasted about 1.5 hours. Payoffs from the experi- ment, denominated in ‘‘points,’’ were converted into money at the rate of 10 points to CHF 2.50 (CHF 1 & $1 at the time of the study). On average, subjects earned about CHF 42.0, which includes a show-up fee of CHF 15. IV. Study 1: Market Shares and Prices We ﬁrst present the results of the Market Baseline, to iden- tify the extent to which concern for social impact is reﬂected in market outcomes, that is, market shares and relative prices. Then, we study how varying market and technological conditions—increased ﬁrm competition, limited consumer infor- mation, and increased production costs—inﬂuence social respon- sibility. In Section V, we shift our attention to the individual behavior of consumers and ﬁrms. We defer a comparison of the Market Baseline and No Market conditions to Section VII, after presenting Study 2 in Section VI. This is because Study 2 also includes identical market and nonmarket conditions, and we thus present a more thorough analysis using the combined data. IV.A. Market Baseline In 99% of cases (831 of 840 consumer choices), consumers purchased a product. Therefore, our analysis will primarily TABLE I SESSION OVERVIEW AND NUMBER OF OBSERVATIONS Treatment Markets Firms Consumers Third parties (Participant A) (Participant B) (Participant C) Market Baseline 7 42 35 35 High Firm Competition 6 48 30 30 Limited Information (Free) 6 363030 Limited Information (Costly) 6 363030 High Production Cost 6 36 30 30 No Market – 35 35 35 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS234 focus on the realized purchases by consumers; unless otherwise noted, we ignore cases in which a consumer made no product purchase. The solid line in Figure I displays the proportion of fair prod- ucts purchased by consumers across time in the Market Baseline. This statistic identiﬁes how often the externality on third parties was mitigated and therefore corresponds to the efﬁciency of the market. To smooth random variation across periods, we report data aggregated in three-period blocks. The ﬁgure reveals a large and stable share of fair products in the Market Baseline. This share is 50% in the ﬁrst three periods, then decreases slightly, but remains between 42% and 46% in all remaining three-period blocks. The overall market share of fair products in the Market Baseline is 44.3%. 12 Thus, as measured by product purchases, we observe a persistent manifestation of socially re- sponsible behavior in market exchange, with almost half of real- ized trades revealing an apparent concern for avoiding the imposition of the externality. Table II reports probit regressions, with subject random ef- fects, of consumers’ product choices. All models include period as an explanatory variable; the coefﬁcient for this variable is never statistically signiﬁcant. Model 2 introduces an explanatory vari- able measuring the size of the choice set available to the con- sumer (recall that consumers acting later saw subsets of the original product offers), which has no effect on the frequency of fair product choices.13 Model 3 restricts the data to cases in which a consumer saw both types of products, again ﬁnding no time trend. Model 4 reveals that consumers respond sensibly to prices: they are less likely to purchase a fair product as the lowest price at which one is available rises and, conversely, 12. When a consumer’s choice set included at least one product of each type, the frequency of fair product purchases is slightly higher (48.1%). We also compare purchases based on whether consumers were randomly selected to choose earlier (when there were more product options available) or later in a period. When con- sumers observed all six product offers, including at least one product of each type, 45.3% purchased fair products. When consumers observed only two product offers (i.e., a consumer was last to act) this frequency is 42.5%. The small difference sug- gests that consumers did not strategically alter their behavior to inﬂuence choice sets of later-acting consumers. 13. Alternatively, if we construct binary variables for whether a consumer saw two, three, four, ﬁve, or six product offers, and use these variables instead, none of the coefﬁcients are statistically signiﬁcant. DO MARKETS ERODE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY? 235 they are more likely to buy a fair product as the lowest price at which an unfair product is available increases. Consumers’ concern for social impact is also reﬂected in a persistent price difference for the two types of products. Products that produce no social harm trade at higher prices than socially harmful products throughout the experiment. This price premium increases over time, from 2.7 in the ﬁrst six pe- riods to 4.8 in the ﬁnal six periods.14 This trend is illustrated by the solid line in Figure II, which shows the price premium for the fair product—that is, the mean price of the fair product minus the mean price of the unfair product—in the Market Baseline condi- tion. By the end of the experiment, when the price premium is approximately 5, the 10-unit cost of mitigating the externality is thus borne equally by sellers and buyers.

Model 1 reports estimates using data from the Market Baseline condition and reveals that the general price decrease across time is signiﬁcant, that the fair product sells at a signiﬁcantly higher price, and that the gap be- tween the two prices increases over time.

Offering the fair product led to lower expected proﬁts for ﬁrms—the average proﬁt for ﬁrms offering fair products was 114.2, whereas it was 119.1 for ﬁrms offering unfair products—but a signiﬁcant proportion of ﬁrms’ product offers (44.1%) were nevertheless fair. The proportion of fair product offers by ﬁrms differs little between the ﬁrst (43.1%) and second (45.2%) halves of the experiment. The probability of having an offer accepted was similar for both fair (83%) and unfair (82%) product offers.

Outcomes in the Market Baseline condition reveal a signiﬁcant and stable concern by consumers and ﬁrms for the welfare of the third party, reﬂected both in market share and in relative prices for the two kinds of products. IV.B. Increased Firm Competition Our second market condition increases the number of ﬁrms, from six to eight, thereby increasing competition and likely put- ting downward pressure on prices. Returning to Figure I, the dotted line shows that the High Firm Competition condition yields a slightly higher frequency of fair products relative to the Market Baseline. Speciﬁcally, the overall market share of fair products increases from 44% to 54%. Models 1 and 2 in Table IV report the results of random-effects probit regressions of the type of product purchased, comparing the Market Baseline and High Firm Competition conditions. Model 1 shows no signif- icant difference between the Market Baseline (omitted category) and High Firm Competition conditions, in terms of overall fair product market shares. Model 2 additionally tests for differences in condition-speciﬁc time trends, again revealing no signiﬁcant treatment effects. We also observe the price premium for the fair product that we found in the Market Baseline condition. Reﬂecting basic eco- nomic forces, increased competition lowers prices for both types of products (see Figure B.1 in the Online Appendix). More impor- tant, for our purposes, the price difference for the two types of products persists under High Firm Competition and if anything is slightly greater; this is apparent in the dotted line in Figure II. The price premium for the fair product increases to about 8 near the end of the experiment under High Firm Competition, which is higher than in the Market Baseline and close to the marginal production cost for ﬁrms. Nevertheless, many consumers are will- ing to pay the greater price premium for the fair product, as in- dicated by the market share in Figure I. Returning to Table III, in model 2, we see that the lower prices with High Firm Competition are reﬂected in the smaller coefﬁcient for the constant term, relative to the Market Baseline. We also observe the persistent price premium for fair products, reﬂected in the positive and signiﬁcant coefﬁcient for that vari- able and for the interaction term with period, both of which are DO MARKETS ERODE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY? 239TABLEIVRANDOM-EFFECTSPROBITREGRESSIONSOFFAIRCONSUMERPRODUCTCHOICEINMARKETBASELINEANDALTERNATIVEMARKETCONDITIONS(1)(2)(3)(4)(5)(6)(7)(8)Baselinevs.HighFirmCompetitionBaselinevs.LimitedInfo.(Free)Baselinevs.LimitedInfo.(Costly)Baselinevs.HighProductionCostTreatment0.3730.494\u00020.314\u00020.472\u00020.1360.167\u00020.896**\u00020.867**(0.359)(0.333)(0.374)(0.378)(0.307)(0.308)(0.387)(0.401)Period\u00020.007\u00020.007\u00020.007\u00020.007(0.008)(0.008)(0.008)(0.008)Period\u0004treatment\u00020.0100.013\u00020.025\u00020.002(0.013)(0.016)(0.017)(0.017)Constant\u00020.085\u00020.001\u00020.0830.002\u00020.098\u00020.014\u00020.0790.005(0.230)(0.209)(0.232)(0.211)(0.225)(0.204)(0.234)(0.213)Observations1,5421,5421,5261,5261,5331,5331,5171,517Num.ofsubjects6565656565656565Notes.Thedependentvariableinallmodelstakesonvalue1ifaconsumerpurchasedafairproductand0otherwise.Thetablereportsrawprobitcoefﬁcients.EachmodelcontainsthepurchasingdecisionfromtheMarketBaselineandoneadditionaltreatment,asindicatedinthecolumnheading.TheomittedcategoryisMarketBaselineandTreatmentisabinaryvariabletakingonvalue1ifanobservationcomesfromtherespectiveadditionaltreatmentand0otherwise.Periodtakesonintegervaluesbetween1and24.Weomitcasesinwhichconsumersmadenoproductpurchase.Themodelsallowforindividuallevelrandomeffects.Robuststandarderrors(clusteredbysubject)inparentheses,***p<.01,**p<.05,*p<.1. QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS240 higher under High Firm Competition than for the Market Baseline. RESULT 2. Outcomes in the High Firm Competition condition reveal a signiﬁcant and stable concern for the welfare of the third party, reﬂected in both market shares and relative prices for the two kinds of products. Increased ﬁrm competi- tion lowers prices relative to the Market Baseline. Socially responsible behavior is slightly, but statistically insigniﬁ- cantly, higher under High Firm Competition than in the Market Baseline. IV.C. Limited Consumer Information We next analyze the case in which consumers initially pos- sess limited information about the types of the different available products in a period, but have the opportunity to acquire such information for free or at a small cost. The lines of varying dash length in Figure I show that under Limited Information, the over- all market shares of fair products across all periods decreases to about 40%, for both conditions, slightly lower than the 44% in the Market Baseline. Looking at the second half of the experiment, where time trends are fairly ﬂat, the fair product market shares are ordered in the manner one would expect—highest in the Market Baseline, lower with Free Limited Information, and lowest under Costly Limited Information—but with differences that are not very large in magnitude. Models 3 to 6 in Table IV provide statistical comparisons of product market shares in the Market Baseline with the two Limited Information conditions. Models 3 and 5 show that there are no signiﬁcant differences in market shares, for either of the two Limited Information condi- tions. Models 4 and 6 additionally show that there are also no signiﬁcant differences in time trends. A persistent concern for the welfare of the third party is again reﬂected in the relative prices of the two product types. The two varying-length dashed lines in Figure II show an increas- ing price premium for the fair product in both Limited Information conditions. Returning to Table III, models 3 and 4 present coefﬁcient estimates for random-effects regressions of price on product type and across time for the two conditions. The price premium for the fair product is statistically signiﬁcant DO MARKETS ERODE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY? 241 throughout the experiment and signiﬁcantly increasing for Free Limited Information, a similar pattern as in the Market Baseline. Under Costly Limited Information, the price premium increases marginally signiﬁcantly over time, but the overall difference only becomes statistically signiﬁcant after a few periods.16 RESULT 3. Outcomes in both Limited Information conditions reveal a signiﬁcant and stable concern for the welfare of the third party, reﬂected both in market shares and in relative prices for the two kinds of products. Relative to the Market Baseline, the concern for the welfare of the third party, man- ifested in purchasing behavior, is slightly but not signiﬁ- cantly reduced when acquiring product information is costly. Consumers in the Limited Information (Free) condition ac- quired product information 73% of the time, while information acquisition in the Limited Information (Costly) condition is less frequent (42%). These frequencies are fairly stable across time. Moreover, information acquisition appears to be instrumental. Consumers who do not acquire information end up purchasing unfair products 87% of the time. 17 Conversely, a large majority of consumers who pay for information purchase fair products. Thus, information use appears generally sensible, with those con- sumers interested in acting socially responsibly acquiring and using the information and those less concerned with social impact simply remaining uninformed and purchasing the least expensive product. IV.D. High Production Cost Finally, we consider the market with a high production cost for the socially responsible product. In this condition, the mar- ginal cost of producing the socially responsible product equals 40 16. Speciﬁcally, statistical rejection of the condition that, Fair Product + t * Period \u0004 Fair Product = 0, based on the estimates in model 3, reaches a level of signiﬁcance of p = .05 (\u00022(1) = 3.77) in period t =3. 17. While consumers who do not acquire information in either condition do not know (and are not informed, ex post) which type of product they are purchasing, they almost always purchase the cheapest product available, which is typically an unfair product. The high level of product type information implicit in offer prices might partly explain the small effect of consumers’ limited information on market outcomes. In Online Appendix C, we provide a more detailed analysis of consumers’ information acquisition and subsequent purchase decisions. QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS242 units, or 80 percent of the surplus from exchange, four times higher than in other conditions. The dashed line in Figure I shows that this increase in the cost of producing the socially responsible product leads to a con- siderably lower market share: 24 percent across all periods, close to half of that in the Market Baseline. Models 7 and 8 in Table IV provide statistical comparisons of fair product market shares in the Market Baseline and High Production Cost conditions. Consistent with Figure I, the latter yields signiﬁcantly lower fre- quencies of fair products, with no time trend in either condition. Thus, while previous changes to the market—increased competi- tion and limited information—had little effect on the fair product market share, making the fair product more costly to produce has a much larger impact. However, it is also noteworthy that the market share of fair products remains constant throughout the experiment, revealing stability in socially responsible behavior— though at a lower level—similar to that in the Market Baseline.18 As is evident in Figure II, there is again a persistent and increasing price premium for the fair product. Not surprisingly, the price premium is higher with High Production Costs—close to 14 units over the entire experiment—than in the other market conditions. As with our other market conditions, however, the average price premium remains below the full cost of socially re- sponsible production, meaning that ﬁrms and consumers share the burden of implementing socially responsible outcomes.19 RESULT 4. Outcomes in the High Production Cost condition reveal a signiﬁcant and stable concern for the welfare of the third party, reﬂected both in market shares and in relative prices for the two kinds of products. With High Production Cost, the price premium for the fair product is higher and the market share for the fair product is signiﬁcantly lower than in the Market Baseline. 18. The high production cost slightly increases the frequency with which con- sumers opt not to buy a product, from 1% in the Market Baseline to 4.7% across all periods, and 3.9% in the second half of the experiment. A random-effects probit regression of no-purchase choices on High Production Cost condition, period, and the interaction of these two variables reveals no signiﬁcant difference between the High Production Cost and Market Baseline conditions. The frequency of no-pur- chase choices is low (3.5% or below) in all other conditions. 19. The application of the Fehr and Schmidt (1999) model in Online Appendix A predicts both the lower market share of fair products and the smaller relative price premium in the High Production Cost condition. DO MARKETS ERODE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY? 243 V. Study 1: Individual Consumer and Firm Behavior Our analysis thus far has focused on aggregate market outcomes—product shares and prices—as a way of studying socially responsible market behavior. We next shift our attention to the individual behavior of consumers and ﬁrms. If market outcomes truly reﬂect socially responsible behavior, then such concern should show up as part of a sensible dimension of the decision making of market participants. Moreover, average pref- erences for social responsibility should be relatively similar across market environments, even when behavior changes in response to market factors like prices and costs. V.A. Consumer Behavior We assume that individuals potentially care both about their own material payoff and about the social impact of their product choice. A simple way to capture such preferences is with a linear utility function of the form, u ¼ \u0003 x þ \u0004 y, where \u0003> 0 represents the weight that consumers place on their own monetary payoff (value of the product purchased minus the price paid), indicated by x, and \u0004 captures their concern, or social responsibility, for the third party, whose payoff is indicated by y. Thus, for example, consumers with \u0004 ¼ 0 care only about buying the product at the lowest price, while consumers for whom 0 <\u0005 \u0003 ¼ \u0004 are will- ing to sacriﬁce up to \u0005 units of own wealth for a one unit increase in the third party’s wealth. We estimate the weights in the above utility speciﬁcation, using McFadden’s (1974) conditional logit choice model. Speciﬁcally, Table V reports coefﬁcient estimates for utility func- tions of the form, uitj ¼ \u0003 xitj þ \u0004 yitj þ XK k¼1 \u0006jk zitk ! þ \u0007itj; which describe the utility to a consumer, i, in period t, from prod- uct alternative, j 2 0; 1; 2; ...; Jit\u0002\u0003 , where Jit is the number of product alternatives available. The option not to purchase a prod- uct, which is always available, corresponds to j ¼ 0, and the actual number of product offers observed by the consumer is in- dicated by 2 \u0005 Jit \u0005 6, except for High Firm Competition, where 4 \u0005 Jit \u0005 8. The variables, zitk, correspond to K variables that vary between cases (i.e., between subjects and periods) but not QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS244TABLEVESTIMATEDWEIGHTSFORCONSUMERUTILITYMODEL(1)(2)(3)(4)(5)(6)BaselineMarketBaseline&HighFirmCompetitionBaseline&Lim.Info.(Free)Baseline&Lim.Info.(Costly)Baseline&HighCostAllmarketconditionsConsumerearnings(\u0003)0.372***0.370***0.395***0.439***0.214***0.282***(0.062)(0.054)(0.044)(0.054)(0.069)(0.041)Third-partyearnings(\u0004)0.033***0.032***0.034***0.038***0.020***0.025***(0.006)(0.007)(0.006)(0.006)(0.008)(0.006)Thirdparty(\u0004)\u0004H.F.Competition0.0080.005(0.009)(0.008)Thirdparty(\u0004)\u0004Lim.Info.(Free)0.0000.001(0.009)(0.008)Thirdparty(\u0004)\u0004Lim.Info.(Costly)\u00020.018**\u00020.012(0.009)(0.008)ThirdParty(\u0004)\u0004HighProd.Cost0.0060.006(0.009)(0.011)Observations4,2059,2477,8357,8217,84820,136Cases84015601560156015603,720Notes.ThetablereportscoefﬁcientestimatesforutilityfunctionsasspeciﬁedinSectionV.A,usingMcFadden’s(1974)conditionallogitchoicemodel.\u0003denotestheweightconsumersplaceontheirownpayoffand\u0004denotestheweightconsumersplaceonthethirdparties’payoff.Model1containsallconsumerdecisionsfromtheMarketBaseline.Models2through5eachadditionallycontaindatafromoneadditionaltreatment.Inthesemodels,theomittedcategoryisMarketBaselineandtherespectivetreatmentvariableisbinaryandtakesonvalue1ifanobservationcomesfromtherespectiveadditionaltreatmentand0otherwise.Model6containsthedatafromallmarketconditions.Allmodelsincludeperiod,genderandln(age)ascase-speciﬁc(intercept)terms(coefﬁcientsomitted).Robuststandarderrors(clusteredbysubject)inparentheses,***p<.01,**p<.05,*p<.1. DO MARKETS ERODE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY? 245 across alternatives in a case. Speciﬁcally, in our estimated models, K ¼ 3, corresponding to period, female sex, and (the nat- ural logarithm of) age. Because the labeling of the different prod- uct options is irrelevant in our experiment (product choice options were unlabeled and were presented in random order), except for the option not to purchase a product in a period (which was always available and uniquely identiﬁable), we impose the re- striction that \u0006jk ¼ \u0006j0k, for all j; j0 6¼ 0. Finally, \u0007itj corresponds to an idiosyncratic extreme-value (logit) random utility error. Model 1 in Table V reports the coefﬁcient estimates for \u0003 and \u0004, for the Market Baseline condition.20 Consumers care both about their own monetary payoff (\u0003> 0) and about the welfare of the third party (\u0004> 0).21 Thus, the apparent social concern that we observe in aggregate market outcomes is also apparent in the purchasing behavior of individual consumers. Moreover, the ratio of the two coefﬁcients can be interpreted as the relative concern that the average consumer places on her own payoff versus the payoff of the third party. In the case of the Market Baseline, this ratio is approximately 11, suggesting that, on average, consumers are willing to sacriﬁce 1 unit of wealth to beneﬁt the third party by 11 units. The remaining models all introduce condition-speciﬁc inter- cept terms to measure the extent to which concern for social impact differs in each condition, relative to the Market Baseline. Speciﬁcally, models 2 through 5 each use data from the Market Baseline and one additional market condition and 20. The table omits the case-speciﬁc intercept terms (\u0006jk). Selecting not to make a product purchase is generally infrequent. However, the coefﬁcient estimates sug- gest that consumers tended to make the no-purchase option more frequently later in the experiment and as they reported an older age, though these are not always statistically signiﬁcant. Omitting these intercept terms from the estimated models does not substantively change the results. 21. We chose a simple utility framework with direct concern for the third party’s payoff for simplicity. If, instead, for comparability with the theoretical analysis in Online Appendix A, we modify the estimated model to reﬂect concern for inequality with respect to the third party, the nature and statistical strength of the results are identical to those in Table V. Also for simplicity, we assume that consumers do not care about the ﬁrm’s wealth. As we note earlier, prior experimental evidence sug- gests that fairness between market participants is often extinguished in repeated market exchange (Kachelmeier, Limberg, and Schadewald 1991; Francoisi et al. 1995). Indeed, we conﬁrm this to be the case in our data: if we conduct the estimation in this section and additionally include ﬁrm proﬁts, the result is a statistically insigniﬁcant coefﬁcient for the ﬁrm’s proﬁt but no substantive change to any of the other results. QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS246 introduce an interaction term between condition and third-party earnings to measure differential concern for the welfare of the third party. Model 6 includes data from all market conditions and simultaneously estimates all the condition-speciﬁc interac- tion terms. The estimates reveal fairly stable concern for social impact across most market conditions, with interaction coefﬁ- cient estimates that are typically small, positive (indicating, if anything, increased concern for social impact), and generally sta- tistically insigniﬁcant. The lone exception is the Limited Information (Costly) condition. When consumers have to pay for information about the social impact of their purchases, their pur- chasing behavior reﬂects decreased concern for the welfare of the third party. 22 However, if we estimate the model separately for this condition alone, the coefﬁcients for both Consumer Earnings and Third Party Earnings are positive and highly statistically signiﬁcant (\u0003 = 0.575 (0.010); \u0004 = 0.024 (0.005); both p < .001). Thus, although apparent concern for social impact appears lower in this condition, it is nevertheless present. The overall pattern of stable preferences is striking and observable quite clearly in model 6. The same estimated utility weights character- ize behavior across all ﬁve market conditions: we fail to reject a test of the restriction that all four interaction terms in model 6 jointly equal zero (\u00022 4ðÞ = 6.06, p = .195). These results are espe- cially interesting in light of the lower market share of the fair product in the High Production Cost condition because they reveal that this behavioral change occurs without substantive changes in the estimated underlying consumer preferences. This suggests that subjects’ preferences for positive social impact are a stable mechanism driving behavior in all market conditions. RESULT 5. Consumer’s purchasing behavior reﬂects concern for both the price and the social impact of the product and this concern is fairly stable across all market conditions. 22. The estimated model ignores the information-acquisition stage and associ- ated cost, that is, we implicitly assume such costs are zero and that consumers know the product characteristics. In principle, one could estimate a model that includes the endogenous information acquisition decision, but this requires assumptions regarding beliefs held by consumers about the characteristics of different products, based on observed prices. Given the ad hoc nature of such assumptions, we limit our analysis to a comparison of product purchases based on the known (to the experi- menter) characteristics of products and ignore the (small) utility implications of costly information acquisition. DO MARKETS ERODE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY? 247 Compared to the Market Baseline, social concern among con- sumers, relative to self-interest, is lower only in the Limited Information (Costly) condition. V.B. Firm Behavior We also study the decisions of individual ﬁrms regarding which type of product to produce. Table VI reports random-effects probit regression results, using as the dependent variable whether a ﬁrm chose to offer a fair (1) or unfair (0) product in a period. Model 1 reveals no differences between conditions in the ten- dency of ﬁrms to offer fair products, with the exception of the High Production Cost condition, where ﬁrms offer fair products signiﬁcantly less frequently. This concords with the general pat- tern in Figure I. Model 2 studies the effect of a variable that identiﬁes whether a ﬁrm offered a fair product in the previous period. The positive and statistically signiﬁcant coefﬁcient sug- gests a tendency to repeatedly offer the same product type across periods. Model 3 adds as an explanatory variable a simple mea- sure of the relative expected proﬁtability of the two product types. Speciﬁcally, we calculate, for each period in a market, the average realized proﬁt in the prior period for ﬁrms that offered the fair product minus the average realized proﬁt for ﬁrms that offered the unfair product, including proﬁts of 100 for ﬁrms with unsold product offers. This measure identiﬁes how much more (or less) ﬁrms earned by offering the fair product than by offering the unfair one. The positive and signiﬁcant coefﬁcient for this vari- able indicates that ﬁrms respond to the prior relative proﬁtability of the two kinds of products, becoming more likely to offer a fair product as such products become relatively more proﬁtable. Finally, model 4 jointly incorporates all the foregoing vari- ables. The type of product offered by the ﬁrm in the prior period and the expected proﬁtability of the fair product retain their sta- tistical signiﬁcance, and the magnitude of the coefﬁcients remains similar to that in models 2 and 3. However, the treat- ment effect for High Production Cost decreases substantially in magnitude and is no longer statistically signiﬁcant. Thus, whereas model 1 indicates a treatment effect of High Production Costs on ﬁrm decision making, model 4 reveals that QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS248 this is largely accounted for by the impact of the higher produc- tion costs on expected ﬁrm proﬁts. RESULT 6. Firms offer more fair products when such products are more proﬁtable. This difference in expected proﬁtability ac- counts for differences in the frequencies of fair product offers by ﬁrms across market conditions. Firms, on average, show a tendency to repeat prior product type choices. V.C. Consumer and Firm Heterogeneity The foregoing analyses obscure potentially signiﬁcant individ- ual differences in concern for social impact. Indeed, individual choice experiments—for example, using dictator games—usually reveal heterogeneous concerns for fairness (Camerer 2003; TABLE VI RANDOM-EFFECTS PROBIT REGRESSIONS OF FIRM PRODUCT DECISIONS (1) (2) (3) (4) High Firm Competition 0.359 0.337 (0.415) (0.388) Limited Information (Free) \u00020.413 \u00020.346 (0.474) (0.448) Limited Information (Costly) \u00020.112 \u00020.067 (0.459) (0.434) High Production Cost \u00021.323** \u00020.565 (0.554) (0.522) Firm offered fair product last period 0.298** 0.357*** (0.119) (0.126) Expected fair product proﬁt premium 0.028*** 0.030*** (0.004) (0.004) Constant \u00020.123 \u00020.504*** \u00020.209 \u00020.250 (0.324) (0.153) (0.164) (0.308) Observations 4,752 4,554 4,396 4,396 Number of subjects 198 198 198 198 Notes.

DO MARKETS ERODE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY? 249 Engel 2011). Online Appendix D presents histograms showing how often each individual consumer and ﬁrm purchased or offered a fair product, across the entire experiment. The results reveal sig- niﬁcant heterogeneity. In all conditions, large proportions of sub- jects—roughly 50% in the second half of the experiment—never change their behavior, meaning they either always or never pur- chase or offer a fair product. The remaining subjects are fairly dispersed in their behavior, exchanging fair products with varying frequency, which is consistent with the price and expected proﬁt sensitivity that we identiﬁed in the previous two sections. VI. Study 2: Market and Nonmarket Behavior in Switzerland and China Our ﬁrst study shows that many market participants in Switzerland take into account the external impacts of their market activity. We next explore possible variation across socie- ties in social responsibility, by conducting a second study jointly in Switzerland and China. VI.A. Design The primary focus of our study consists of sessions of the Market Baseline condition, conducted (as described in Section III.A) in Switzerland and China. In these Market Switzerland and Market China conditions, ﬁve consumers and six ﬁrms inter- acted exactly as in Study 1, with their market behavior poten- tially affecting ﬁve third parties. Aside from measuring social concern in markets using sub- ject pools in Switzerland and China, we also obtain comparable measures of social concern in nonmarket contexts in both subject pools. This helps us identify, for example, whether any difference in market socially responsible behavior between the two popula- tions is due to a more general difference in social preferences, or whether the market context has different effects in the two sub- ject pools. Hence, we also conducted sessions of the No Market condition (as described in Section III.C) in both Switzerland and China.23 23. For example, in the No Market China condition, a subject in the role of decision maker (Player B) made 24 allocation choices identical to those faced by a consumer in the Market China condition. QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS250 However, although the No Market condition in a country is directly comparable to the corresponding country’s Market con- dition, the No Market conditions are not directly comparable across countries because the choice sets provided to the two sets of nonmarket decision makers in the two countries differ. Therefore, we also conducted a ‘‘swapped’’ variant of the No Market condition in which we provided decision makers in a No Market session conducted in Switzerland (Swapped No Market Switzerland) with a sequence of 24 choices faced by paired con- sumers in the Market China condition. Similarly, we provided subjects in the Swapped No Market China condition with the choices faced by consumers in the Market Switzerland condition. Hence, conducting these Swapped No Market conditions creates a way to directly compare nonmarket behavior across the two sub- ject pools.24 At the end of each session, we also administered the Fair Market Ideology scale developed by Jost et al. (2003). This ques- tionnaire measures whether individuals perceive free markets as a fair system and whether inequality produced by markets is fair. We included this scale to test whether, consistent with prior re- search, Chinese respondents tend to judge market behavior that produces inequality less harshly than respondents in Switzerland (see Gao 2009). VI.B. General Information and Procedures We conducted the study at the University of Zurich and the Shanghai University of Finance and Economics. A total of 616 subjects participated, half in China and half in Switzerland. More precisely, 128 subjects participated in eight Market ses- sions in each country, 40 in the role of consumer. Additionally, 120 subjects participated in the No Market condition in each country, 40 in the role of decision maker. These 40 subjects re- ceived the exact choice sets faced by consumers in the same coun- try’s Market condition. In each country, we also collected Swapped No Market observations for a representative subsample 24. For example, a decision maker in China (Swapped No Market China condi- tion) and one in Switzerland (No Market Switzerland condition) are provided with the same 24 allocation choices in a nonmarket context. These choices are identical to the 24 product choices faced by a market consumer in the Market Switzerland condition. DO MARKETS ERODE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY? 251 of four markets from the respective other country. This required 60 subjects in each country, 20 in the role of decision maker. The general procedures were as described in Section III.E. After conducting sessions in China, which recruited from the broad student population at the Shanghai University of Finance and Economics, we recruited from a comparable distri- bution of study majors in Zurich—roughly 50% from the ﬁelds of ﬁnance, economics and business (Study 2 thus uses a slightly different population for the Zurich sessions than did Study 1). To ensure comparability between the two sets of instructions, we employed a back-translation procedure in writing the Mandarin version of the experimental instructions—one person translated the English instructions into Mandarin and another person did so back into English to identify and reconcile incon- sistencies. The conversion from points into money aims to match the purchasing power of subjects’ payoffs: points were converted into money at the rate of 10 points to CNY 2.5 in Shanghai and, as in Study 1, 10 points to CHF 2.50 in Switzerland. On average, subjects in China earned about CNY 40.7, including a show-up fee of CNY 15; subjects in Switzerland earned about CHF 41.3, including a show-up fee of CHF 15. VI.C. Results We ﬁrst consider responses to the Fair Market Ideology ques- tionnaire (Jost et al. 2003), to identify whether subjects in China hold different notions of what constitutes fair behavior in mar- kets. We construct an aggregate measure by averaging the re- sponses to the 25 scale items, ranging from \u00025 to 5. Higher numbers reﬂect greater agreement with the view that market systems and the outcomes they produce are fair. The average response in China is signiﬁcantly higher than the average re- sponse in Switzerland (respectively, mean [std. err.] = 0.714 [0.011] versus \u00020.102 [0.016], t614 = 8.70, p < .001). Hence, we ﬁnd a greater general perception among respondents in China that the outcomes produced by free markets are fair. 25 25. For example, for the statement, ‘‘In free market systems, people tend to get the outcomes that they deserve’’ (completely disagree: \u00025, completely agree: +5), respondents tend to agree signiﬁcantly more in China than in Switzerland (1.987 versus \u00021.075, t614 = 13.67, p < .001). For the statement, ‘‘When a company raises the prices that it charges its customers for its goods, because management has obtained market research which suggests that its customers are willing to pay QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS252 Our primary interest is in whether we observe differences in market behavior. The solid lines in Figure III present the fair product market shares in the Market conditions in Switzerland (no markers) and China (markers).26 The frequency of fair prod- ucts traded in Switzerland, 48.3% across the entire experiment, is very similar to that in the Market Baseline from Study 1 (44.3%), which provides a direct replication of Result 1, using a new sample of subjects, including different study majors. However, the frequency of fair product purchases in China is much lower: 16.3% across the experiment. Hence, despite studying identical market environments, we observe signiﬁcantly less socially re- sponsible behavior in China than in Switzerland. In fact, the fre- quency of socially responsible market outcomes in China is lower than in any condition from Study 1 (see Figure I), including the one in which the cost of mitigating the externality was four times as high. 27 Models 1 and 2 in Table VII report random-effects probit re- gressions of fair product purchases across experimental locations and time. Consistent with Figure III, the likelihood of a fair prod- uct exchange is signiﬁcantly lower in China than in Switzerland, and this difference is stable over time. 28 We also used the data to estimate the utility models from Section V.A separately for consumers in Switzerland and China (see Online Appendix, Table E.1). Recall that the ratio between the weights placed on own payoffs (\u0003) and those of the third party (\u0004) measures the rel- ative concern by consumers, on average, for these two impacts of more, it is .. .’’ (completely unfair: \u00025, completely fair: +5), respondents in China judged the behavior as more fair (1.292 versus 0.633, t614 = 3.15, p < .01). 26. As with Study 1, we omit cases in which no product was traded (3% in Switzerland, 2% in China). 27. We also observe differences in the price dynamics between Switzerland and China. Average prices in Market Switzerland sessions are similar to those in Study 1, with average prices for the fair product of 30.1 and for the unfair product of 24.7, and a general decreasing trend over the course of the experiment. In China, we observe a smaller price premium (26.1 versus 24.9) that decreases over the course of the experiment; in the ﬁnal third of the experiment there is no difference in price for the two types of products. 28. As in Study 1, consumers in both countries respond sensibly to prices, pur- chasing fair products more often as the relative price of fair products decreases. We also tested whether differences in the tendency for consumers to purchase socially responsible products related to individual variation in responses to the Free Market Ideology scale but ﬁnd no robust relationship between questionnaire responses and behavior in the market. DO MARKETS ERODE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY? 253 a choice. For Switzerland, the estimated ratio is 13, which is close to the estimate of 11 from the Market Baseline from Study 1. However, for China it is almost twice as high (25). Nevertheless, even though the manifestation of social re- sponsibility is weaker in China than in Switzerland, we observe a persistent market share for the socially responsible product even in the market in China. As Figure III and Table VII show, this proportion is stable over time. Hence, despite it being weaker than in Switzerland, we ﬁnd evidence of stable market social re- sponsibility in China. 29 The No Market conditions using the swapped choice sets common to both Switzerland and China allow us to directly com- pare the degrees of social concern in nonmarket settings in the two countries. This is important for interpreting the difference between the two Market conditions in Figure III. On the one0.1.2.3.4.5.6.7.8.91Proportion of Fair Product / Choice 1-3 4-6 7-9 10-12 13-15 16-18 19-21 22-24 Periods Market Switzerland No Market Switzerland Market China No Market China Completed trades by consumers; exludes no purchase / default choice No Market includes only choice sets included in swap, which are identical across countries FIGURE III Fair Product Purchases and Choices in China and Switzerland 29. This is also reﬂected in the estimated consumer utility weights, which reveal a signiﬁcant positive concern for both own payoff and the welfare of the third party in China, as well as in Switzerland (Online Appendix, Table E.1). QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS254 hand, this difference might simply reﬂect a general difference in the propensity to consider the welfare of others, in which case we would expect subjects in China to also exhibit less social concern in a nonmarket context than would subjects in Switzerland. However, this is inconsistent with earlier laboratory evidence showing Chinese not to be systematically less prosocial in nonmarket laboratory decisions (Buchan, Johnson, and Croson 2006; Chuah et al. 2007; Bohnet et al. 2008). Alternatively, it is possible that the difference in behavior arises because of differ- ences in norms speciﬁcally governing behavior in markets, with Chinese individuals exhibiting a greater tolerance for unfair or unethical behavior in markets than respondents in Switzerland, as reﬂected in responses to the Fair Market ideology scale and in prior research. Figure III presents data from the No Market condition in both countries. To allow comparability between No Market data from Switzerland and China, we use only the matched choice sets that were included in the swapped versions of the No Market TABLE VII RANDOM-EFFECTS PROBIT REGRESSIONS OF FAIR CHOICES IN SWITZERLAND AND CHINA (1) (2) (3) (4) Market China & Switzerland No Market China & Switzerland (using matched choice sets only) China \u00021.447*** \u00021.529*** \u00020.033 0.145 (0.297) (0.322) (0.291) (0.286) Period \u00020.010 0.004 (0.013) (0.009) Period \u0004 China 0.006 \u00020.015 (0.017) (0.013) Constant \u00020.002 0.126 0.333 0.280 (0.219) (0.246) (0.206) (0.206) Observations 1,872 1,872 1,711 1,711 Number of subjects 80 80 80 80 Notes.

Hence, the No Market lines in Figure III are based on the same 40 choice sets, each faced by one subject in Switzerland and one in China. In the nonmarket context, we ﬁnd very little difference in behavior between Switzerland and China. Across the entire experiment, subjects in Switzerland and in China select choices that do not harm the third party 56.7% of the time.30 Models 3 and 4 in Table VII report the results of random-effects probit regressions that test for differences in nonmarket behavior between Switzerland and China—again, using only the directly comparable matched choice sets included in the swap. There is no statistically signiﬁcant difference in either levels of exhibited social concern or time trends.31 RESULT 7. Outcomes in both the Market Switzerland and Market China conditions reveal stable concern for the welfare of the third party. The market share of the fair product is signiﬁ- cantly lower in the subject pool in China than in Switzerland. Social concern in the No Market context is very similar be- tween China and Switzerland. VII. Market Versus Nonmarket Social Concern Both studies include No Market conditions that allow direct comparisons between choices made in a nonmarket context and the behavior of individual consumers in the Market Baseline. Recall from the experimental design of Study 1 in Section III that we created the No Market condition by taking the 24 product choice sets facing each consumer in the Market Baseline condi- tion, and presenting these exact 24 choices—with identical mon- etary consequences for a set of three subjects—to another decision maker in the No Market condition. We did the same for the two market conditions in Study 2, Market Switzerland and Market China. Hence, we have three data sets, two in 30. If we include the default choice that gives 100 to each subject, and count this as a fair choice, the proportions rise to 62.4% in Switzerland and 60.4% in China. These frequencies do not differ signiﬁcantly. 31. Table E.1 in the Online Appendix reports estimated utility weights from the swapped No Market choice data for both countries. We ﬁnd very similar degrees of concern for the third party in Switzerland and China, with both models yielding ratios of approximately 6 between concern for own payoff (\u0003) and concern for the third party (\u0004). QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS256 Switzerland and one in China, with which to make market versus nonmarket comparisons of the degree of concern for social impact. Figure IV presents the frequencies of fair product purchases and fair nonmarket choices across all three data sets, as well as the pooled data from Switzerland for Studies 1 and 2. The solid lines indicate fair product purchases in the market conditions and are comparable to the corresponding lines in Figures I and III, except that here we include not purchasing a product in the market and the default egalitarian choice in the nonmarket con- ditions—which yield payoffs of 100 for all three participants—as ‘‘fair.’’32 In every comparison, the Market and No Market lines reﬂect choices from identical choice sets. The top two panels show a similar ﬁnding in the two studies in Switzerland: in both cases, the proportion of fair behavior is higher in the No Market condi- tion than in the Market condition, with differences of 10 percent- age points in Study 1 and 18 percentage points in Study 2. The bottom left panel, which pools the data from both studies in Switzerland, shows an aggregate difference of 14 percentage points. These differences are fairly stable across periods. We ob- serve a similar pattern in China, shown in the bottom right panel. Here, the difference is larger (25 percentage points), which is consistent with our observation in Section VI that there is a greater difference between market and nonmarket social concern in China than in Switzerland.33 Table VIII presents the results of random-effects probit re- gressions of whether a subject made a fair choice. The results support the observations from Figure IV. The ﬁrst two models compare the Market Baseline and No Market from Study 1, the 32. In the No Market conditions, this is a natural interpretation of the egalitar- ian default choice. Recall that not purchasing a product is rare (1%) in the Market Baseline in Study 1, which is also true in Study 2 (3% in Market Switzerland and 2% in Market China). The corresponding default choice is more frequent in the No Market conditions: 3% in Study 1, 8% in Switzerland (Study 2), and 11% in China. 33. The difference for China is somewhat constrained by the fact that many choice sets (54%) faced by consumers and decision makers in China contain no fair product alternative, other than the default; this is much less frequent in the choice sets in Switzerland (Study 1: 26%, Study 2: 24%), and is a consequence of ﬁrms offering fewer fair products in China. If we compare only cases in which a consumer saw at least one fair product and one unfair product (see Online Appendix Figure E.1), the differences between market and nonmarket fair behavior do not change much for Switzerland (e.g., the aggregate difference with the pooled data is 15 percentage points, close to the 14 percentage points difference in Figure IV), but the difference is considerably larger for China (35 percentage points). DO MARKETS ERODE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY? 257 next two do so for Market Switzerland and No Market Switzerland from Study 2, and models 5 and 6 pool the data from both studies in Switzerland. Across models 1–6, the constant term is not signiﬁcantly different from zero, indicating that the frequency of fair choices in markets in Switzerland was close to 50%. The coefﬁcients for No Market are always positive, but only statistically signiﬁcant in some speciﬁcations, indicating that al- though we consistently observe more fair behavior in the nonmar- ket context, the statistical strength of this result is inconsistent. Nevertheless, in the combined sample from Switzerland, we ﬁnd a statistically signiﬁcant tendency to act more fairly in the nonmarket context than in the market. Models 7 and 8 present a comparison of Market China and No Market China. We observe some differences with models 1–6. First, the coefﬁcient for the constant term is negative and statis- tically signiﬁcant, indicating a strong tendency toward the unfair product in the market. Also, the coefﬁcient for the No Market variable is larger for China than for the comparisons from Switzerland.

DO MARKETS ERODE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY? 259 market versus nonmarket contexts appears somewhat stronger in China than in Switzerland.34 The ﬁnal two models identify the overall effect of the nonmar- ket context, across all the data. We include variables to capture the fact that market behavior in China looks very different from market behavior in Switzerland—this is reﬂected in the negative and signiﬁcant coefﬁcients for the China variable. Starting, from these separate levels of market behavior, the coefﬁcient for No Market identiﬁes the effect on socially responsible behavior of the nonmarket context, on aggregate, across all comparisons.35 The positive and highly statistically signiﬁcant coefﬁcients indicate a strong effect of market context on the expression of social concern. RESULT 8. Socially responsible behavior is more prevalent in the No Market condition than in the corresponding Market con- dition across all comparisons. The differences are somewhat stronger in China than in Switzerland. 34. In Online Appendix Table E.2 we again estimate the utility model from Section V.A, allowing concern for the third party to vary between market and nonmarket contexts. Consistent with Table VIII, this interaction is small and sta- tistically insigniﬁcant for the comparison in Switzerland from Study 1, but larger in both size and statistical signiﬁcance for the Swiss data in Study 2 (p < .05) and for the combined Swiss data (p < .01). For the combined comparison for Switzerland, the nonmarket context increases the relative weight placed on the third party’s payoff by 70% (the ratio of importance of own payoff (\u0003) relative to that of the third party (\u0004) declines from 13 to 7). For China, the differences are much larger in both magnitude and statistical signiﬁcance—for example, the weight placed on the third party increases by 223% (the ratio of own concern versus that for the third party is 28 in the market and 9 in the nonmarket context). 35. We do not include the fully interacted model (i.e., with China \u0004 No Market interactions) because our goal is to estimate the overall effect of the nonmarket context, relative to market behavior, jointly across all data sets. The interacted model would instead provide independent estimates of the market effect in differ- ent populations, which is already visible from the separate models. Moreover, sta- tistical inference of the relative size of the market versus nonmarket differences between Switzerland and China using such an interacted model would be problem- atic, given the differences in choice sets between countries in the No Market data. Instead, we provide a more appropriate basis for this statistical comparison in Online Appendix Table E.2, where we rely on parameter estimates from our utility model, as in Table V. As this analysis reveals, the difference in concern for social impact between the market and nonmarket context is statistically signiﬁcantly larger in China than in Switzerland. QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS260 VIII. Conclusion This article studies whether concerns for social responsibility persist in repeated market interaction. We develop a laboratory product market, in which socially responsible behavior by ﬁrms and consumers involves incurring additional production costs to mitigate negative externalities imposed on individuals otherwise uninvolved with the market. The data from Study 1, conducted in Switzerland, show ﬁrst that there is a nontrivial share of socially responsible products supplied and demanded in all market conditions, and that— importantly—the market share is stable over time. Second, the socially responsible product, which costs more to produce, sells at a price premium that persists with market experience. In most cases, this price premium increases over time, suggesting that consumers’ willingness to pay for socially responsible products is not eliminated with repeated market interaction. Third, we show that individual-level market behavior is consistent with a preference for positive social impact, though such concerns are heterogeneous. We also document the robustness of social responsibility in markets to varying market conditions, such as increased seller competition and limited consumer information.36 But we identify one feature of markets for socially responsible products—the technology costs of production—that strongly affects market share. This suggests a critical role for production subsidies as a mechanism for facilitating the adoption of socially responsible products in markets and improving market efﬁciency. Importantly, the pronounced reaction of market behavior to higher production costs occurs without substantive changes in the estimated underlying preferences of market participants, suggesting that subjects’ preferences for positive social impact are an important mechanism driving behavior in all market conditions.37 36. Further evidence that socially responsible market behavior is robust to al- ternative market characteristics is provided by Danz, Engelmann, and Ku¨ bler (2012), who show experimentally that consumers with monopsony power in a du- opoly market setting are willing to pay more for products produced by ﬁrms that pay higher wages to their workers. Their focus is on how such consumer concern is affected by variation in minimum wage policies. 37. Moreover, the robustness of social responsibility in markets to a default state of limited information—which strongly decreases social concern in nonmar- ket settings (Dana, Weber, and Kuang 2007)—suggests that in some ways, market DO MARKETS ERODE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY? 261 A critical feature of our markets is that we provide a tech- nology that can mitigate the externality, at a cost to market par- ticipants. In this sense, our design allows social responsibility to be consistent with market exchange, rather than entirely orthog- onal.38 The prevalence of such technologies is widespread in many existing markets. For example, ‘‘green,’’ ‘‘ethical sourcing,’’ and ‘‘cruelty-free’’ are essentially production methods that typi- cally involve higher costs that must be borne in some combination by ﬁrms and consumers. Hence, it is natural to study social re- sponsibility in the presence of such technologies and understand their role in facilitating socially responsible market behavior. Indeed, our experiment provides clear evidence of the importance of such technologies, and of their costs, for social responsibility in markets. Study 2, comparing behavior between subject pools in Switzerland and China, ﬁnds that socially responsible market behavior is not solely driven by market characteristics or technol- ogy but also varies across populations. Our data show that the frequency of fair product purchases in China is signiﬁcantly lower—roughly a third of the level observed in Switzerland— despite the structure of the experimental markets being identical and despite the fact that subjects in Switzerland and China do not differ in their behavior in our nonmarket context. Indeed, the market share of the fair product in China is lower than in any condition from Study 1. This suggests that cultural differences may play as important a role for the efﬁciency of market outcomes as other key economic factors (North 1981; Tabellini 2008), though more work is necessary to test the extent to which our ﬁndings with student samples extend to broader populations. Finally, in both studies, we employ a novel design that allows us to conduct a direct comparison between the behavior of indi- viduals in market and nonmarket contexts, holding constant most other important factors about the choices they face. Our nonmarket condition is a variant of the much-studied dictator social responsibility may be robust to factors that negatively impact nonmarket prosocial behavior. One possible interpretation of this difference is that the market context (in comparison with nonmarket individual choice contexts) already pro- vides individuals willing to exploit justiﬁcations for acting self-interestedly the ability to do so. 38. For related evidence that the feasibility of prosocial outcomes matters for their realization, in the context of principal-agent relationships, see Charness and Dufwenberg (2011). QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS262 game and thus provides a useful benchmark to which we can compare the level of prosocial behavior in our laboratory markets. Across three data sets, we observe a consistent pattern of dimin- ished social concern in the market context. Hence, market behav- ior does seem to reﬂect less concern for social impact than comparable individual choice settings, even in choices that are consequentially and procedurally identical (cf. Falk and Szech 2013). Moreover, the smaller differences we observe in Switzerland, relative to China, highlight that socially responsible behavior may be more robust to market contexts in some popula- tions than in others. Hence, viewing all our results together, we provide a mixed response to the titular question of our article—do markets erode social responsibility? On the one hand, we ﬁnd positive levels of socially responsible behavior in all our market conditions, both in Switzerland and in China—though the level of socially responsi- ble behavior is much lower in China than in Switzerland. Moreover, irrespective of the different levels of socially responsi- ble behavior we observe in different market settings, in no con- dition does this level persistently erode over time with repeated market interaction. On the other hand, our comparison of behav- ior in market and nonmarket contexts reveals that our subjects behave less socially responsibly in the market setting. Hence, market interaction does lower social concern. Broadly, our results draw attention to the important chal- lenge of understanding better the organizational, technological, and cultural conditions under which markets affect prosocial be- havior. To this end, an appealing feature of our design is that it easily lends itself to further study. Thus, one of our contributions is what we believe to be a valuable and easily modiﬁed experi- mental paradigm for studying the factors that determine social responsibility in markets.
